# LINMA2472_P1
LINMA2472 projet 1



first part would be to transform the PDF to a usable format such as txt 

after that we would need to have a list of all character and a list for all character that play in each scene 

and then we just have to do a concordance matrix to find the relation ship between the characters 
we should represent that as a square matrix 

last part would be to use pyplot to plot the relationship matrix
