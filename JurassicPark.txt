1 EXT JUNGLE NIGHT 
 
 An eyeball,  big,  yellowish, distinctly inhuman,stares raptly  
 betweenwooden slats,part of a larg
e crate. The eye darts from side 
 to side, alert ashell. 
 
 A legend tries to placeus - - 
 
 ISLA NUBLAR 
 120 MILESWEST OFCOSTA RICA 

 
 -  - but tous it's  still the middle of now here. 
 
 It's quiet for a second. A ROAR rises upfromthe jungle, 
 deafening.  The trees 
shake assomething very , 
very large plows ahead  
 throughthem, right atus.Everyhead gathered in this little clearing  
 snaps, turning inthe direction of the sound as it burststhroughthe  
 trees. 
 

 It's a bulldozer.  It drops its scoopand pushesforward into  
 the back end ofthe cr
ate, shovingit across the jungle floor towards 
 an impressive fenced structurethat 
towers over an enclosed section of  
 thick jungle.  There's aguard tower 
at one endof this holding open  
 that makesit look like San Quentin. 
 
 The bulldozer pushes 
forward intothe back  end, the crate THUDS  
 TO THE FLOOR.  A door slides open in the pen, making a space as bigas  
 the end ofthe crate. 

 
 Nobody moves for a second, Agrim-faced guy who seems to be in  
 charge (Robert Muldoon, althou
ghwe don'tknow it yet). 
 
    MULDOON 
  Alright now, push ers move 
in. Loading teammove it. 
 
 The movement as agitated whatever
 is inside the crate, and the  
 whole thing shivers asGROWLS and SNAPS come from inside. 

 Everyone moves back. 
 
    MULDOON (cont'd) 
  Alright, steady. Get back in
 therenow, push. Get back  
  in there, Don't letherknow you're afraid! 
 
 The men go backto the crate and be
gin to push it intothe slot.   
 The crateTHUDS UP AGAINST THE OPENING.  A green light on the side of  
 the pen lights up,show ing contacthas been made. 

 
 FROM INSIDE THE CRATE, 
 we getglimpses ofwhat's on 
the other side of those wooden  
 slates - - jungle foliage, MEN with
rifles, searching searchlights.  
 The view isherky-jerky as 
the crate put into position. 
 
    MULDOON 

  Well locked− Loading team, step away.  Joffrey, raise 
  the gate. 
 
 A WORKERclimbs to the top of the crate. The search lights are  
 trained on the door. 
 
 The RIFFLEMEN throwthe bolts on
 their rifles andCRACKtheir  
 stun guns,sending arcs of current CRAC KINGthroughthe air. 
 
 The WORKER gets ready tograb the gate when all at once - - 

 
 A ROAR from the inside the crate,
 andthepanel flies out ofhis  
 hands andSMACKS into him, knocking him clear offthe crate. 
 
 Now everything happens at once. 
TheWORKER THUDSto the jungle  
 floor, the crate jerks awayfrom the 
mouth oftheholding pen flash, an  
 alarm BUZZER sounds - - 
 
 - - and a claw SLASHES out from in
side the crate.  
It sinks into  
 the ankle of theWORKER. dragging him toward thedark mouth between the  
 crate andthe pen. TheWORKER SCRE
AMS and paws thedirt, leaving long  
 claw marksas he is rapidl
y dragged toward the crate. 
 
 Muldoon SHOUTS orders: 
 
    MULDOON 
 Tasers get in there, Goddamn it! 
 

 TheyFIRE their guns -the 
wood of thecrate SPLINTERS. 
 
 Muldoon runs in andgrabs the WORKER, trying to pull him free. 
 
 Thewild arcs of currents from the stun gunflash andCRACK all  
 around, but in a second - - 
 
 - -theWORKER is gone.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
 
 DONALD GENNARO,forty, in a cityman's ideaof hiking clothes  
 and ahundred dollar haircut, approa
ches on araft being pulled across  
 a river by TWO MEN. 
 
 On the hillside, JUAN ROSTAGNO,thirty-ish, Costa Rican,a  
 smart-looking guy in workers clothes, is waiting forhim. 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  Tengo mil pesos que dicen que secae 

   (I have a thousand pesos that  sayhe falls) 
   (or) 
  Apuesto mil pesos quese cae. 
   (I bet a thousand pesos hefalls) 
 
 Gennaro finally lands, and Rostagno helps him offthe raft. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Hola, Juanito 
 

    ROSTAGNO 
  Hola, bienvenido 
 
 Rostagno leads Gennaro towards 
the mine. Dozen of shirtless  
 WORKERS claw and SCRAPE at a rocky mo
un tain side that is the siteof an  
 extensive mining operation.  The work is all done by hand, pick and  
 shovel instead of dynamite and bulldozer. 
 
    GENNARO 

  What's thisI hear atthe airport− Hammond'snot even 
  here? 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  He sends his apologies. 
 
    GENNARO 
  You're telling me thatwe're facinga $20 million  
  lawsuit from thefamily ofthat in
jured worker and Hammond couldn't  
  even be bothered to see me? 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  He had to leave early to be with his daughter.She's 
  getting a divorce. 
 
    GENNARO 
  I understand that. 
   (or) 

  I'm sorry to hear that.We'd bewell advised to deal 
  with this situation now.  The insurance company - - 
 
 Gennaro almost falls, Rostagnohelps him. 
 
    GENNARO (cont'd) 
  - -theunderwriters of th e pa
rkfeel the accident raises  
  some very serious questions about 
the safety of the park,and they're 
  making thein vestors very anxious. I had to promise I would conduct a  

  thorough on-site inspection. 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  Hammond hates inspections. 
 They slow ev
erything down. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really  

  slow things down. 
   (or) 
  If  they pull the fundingthat's going to slowthings 
  down around here. 
 
 A WORKERhurries upto them an
dbusts into the conversation,  
 breathless. 
 
    WORKER 
   (to Rostagno) 

  Jefe, encontramos otro mo
squito, en el 
mismo sitio. 
   (Chief, wefound another mosquito in the same place) 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  Seguro? Muestrame! 
   (Are you sure? Show me.) 
 
 The WORK ER and ROSTAGNO scramble 
back deeper into the mine.   
 Rostagno calls back over
 his shoulder to Gennaro. 
 
    ROSTAGNO (cont'd) 
  It seems like it's goingto be a good day afterall. 
  They found another one! C'mon. 
 
 Gennaro struggles to keep up. 
 
 
3  EXT CAVE DAY 

 
 
 ROSTAGNOand GENNARO move into th
e dark, dripping cave, where at  
 least a dozen other WORKERS aregather
ed ina tightcircle, staring at  
 something intently. 
 
 Rostagno fights his way to the ce
nter of the group.
 One of the  
 WORK ERShand s him something and Rostagno examines it caref ully. 
 

 It's a chuck of amber,a shiny ye
llow rock aboutthe sizeof a  
 half dollar. 
 GENNARO 
 If two experts sign off on
 the island, the insurance  
 guys'll back off.  I already got IanMalcolm, but they think he'stoo  
 trendy.  They want Alan Grant. 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  Grant? You'll never get him out ofMontana. 

 
    GENNARO 
  Why not? 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
  Because he's like me.  He's a digger. 
 

 Rostagnoturns andholds the ambe
r up to the sunlight streaming  
 throughthe mouth of the cave. 
 
 With the light pouring through it,the amber is translucent, and  
 we can seesomething inside this strange stone - - 
 
 - - a hugemosquito, long dead, entombed there. 
 
    ROSTAGNO 
   (smiles) 

  Hay que lindo eres vashacer a much gente feliz. 
   (Oh you'reso beaut iful. Youwill make a lot  of  
   people happy)

5  EXT THEDIG DAY 

 
 An artist's camel hair brush carefully sweeps away sand and rock  
 to slowly reveal the dark curve of 
a fossil - it'sa claw. A dentist's  
 pick gently lifts it from the place its has laid formillions of years.   
 Pull up to reveal a group of diggers
 working on a large skelet on.  All  
 we see arethe tops oftheir hats. 
The paleontologist  working on the  
 claw lays it in his hand. 
 
    GRANT 

   (thoughtfully) 
  Four complete skeletons... . 
  such a small area. . .  
  the same time horizon- - 
 
    ELLIE 
  They died together? 
 
    GRANT 

  The taphonomy sure looks thatway. 
 
    ELLIE 
  If they died together, they lived together.  
  Suggests some kind
 ofsocial order. 
 
 DR ALAN GRANT, mid-thirties, a 
ragged-looking guy with intense  
 concentration youwouldn't wantto get intheway of,carefully  
 examines a claw. 

 
 DR ELLIE SATTLER ,working with him, leans in close and studies  
 it too.  Shepaints the exposed bone with rubber cement. Ellie in her 
 late twenties, athletic-looking. Ther
e's an impatience aboutEllie, as  
 if  nothing in lif e happens quite f astenough f orher. 
 
 Her face is almost pressed up 
againsthis, she's sitting so 

 close. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Theyhunted as ateam.  The dismembered tenontosaurus 
  bone over there - that's 
lunch. But what killed our 
  raptors in a lakebed, in a bunch like this? Webetter 
  come upwith something that makes sense. 
 
    ELLIE 
  A drought. The lake was shrinking- - 

 
    GRANT 
   (excited) 
  That's good.  That
's right!  Theydied around a dried-up 
  puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking 
  good. 
 
 From the bottom ofthehill a voice SHOUTS tothem: 
 

    VOLUNTERR (o.s.) 
  Dr Grant!Dr Sattler! We're ready to try again! 
 
 Grant SIGNS andsits up, stretching out his back. 
 
    GRANT 
  I hate computers. 
 
 He shoves the claw absent-minde
dly intohis pocket and he and  
 Ellie walk toward the source ofthe 
voice.  Astheywalk,we get our  
 first look atthe badlands. Ex
posedoutcroppings of crumbling  
 limestone stretch for miles in every direction, not a tree ora bush in  
 sight. 
 
 In the dig itself, theground 
is checkered withexcavations  
 everywhere.  There's abase campwi
thfive or six teepees, a flapping 
 mess tent,a fewcards, 
a flatbed truckwith wra
pped fossils loaded on 
 it, and a mobile home. There are a dozen VOLUNTEERS of all ages at  

 work in various places around the 
dig.  The Volunteers are from all  
 walks of life, dinosaurbuffs. Three or four ofthem have CHILDREN  
 wit h them,and the kids run ar
ound, like in agiant sandbox. 
 
 Grant , Ellie and a Volunteer walkdown the hill. Grant spots a  
 KIDkickingdirt onto one of th
e digs.  Henotices andfrowns. 
 
    GRANT 
  What's that kid doing? 

   (to the kid) 
  What areyou doingthere!? Excuse me! Can you just back 
  off? This isvery fragile!  Are you out of yourmind?  
  Get offthat andgo find yourparents! 
   (to Ellie) 
  Did you see whathe just did? 
 

 The kid stomps away,pissed off. 
 
    KID 
  Asshole. 
 
    GRANT 
   (to Ellie) 
  Why do they have to bring their kids?! 
 
    ELLIE 

  You could hire yourhelp.  Butthere's four summers of 
  workhere,with th e money for one.  And you say it's a  
  learning experience, sort 
of a vacation, and you get  
  volunteers with kids. 
 
 He andEllie arrive to where 
several VOLUNTEERS are clustered  
 around a computer terminal that's 
setup on a table in a small tent,  
 its flaps lashed open. 
 

    GRANT 
   (to the Volunteer) 
  Ready to give it a shot, Jerry? 
 
 A LITTLE GIRL moves a little 
too close to themachine. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Want to watch the computer? 
 

 Ellie quietly moves herout of Grant's way,to a place she can  
 see. 
 
    VOLUNTEER 
  Thumper ready? 
 
    MAN 
  Ready. 
 

    VOLUNTEER 
  Fire. 
 
 The VOLUNTEER throws a swit ch on
 a machine that looks a bit like  
 a floor buffer.  Thewhole thinghops up into the air as it drives a  
 soft lead pellet into theearth with
 a tremendous force. There is a  
 dull THUD, the earthseems to vibr
ate, and all eyes
 turn to the  
 computer screen - - 
 

    ELLIE 
  How long does this usually take? 
 
    VOLUNTEER 
  It should be immediate retu
rn. You shoot the radar into 
  the ground, thebone bouncesback.... 
 

  The screen suddenly comes alive,
 yellow contour lines tracing  
  across it inthree waves, detailing a dinosaur skeleton. 
 
    VOLUNTEER 
  This new program's incredib le!   A few more years of   
  development and you don'thaveto dig any more! 
 
 Grant looksat him, and his expr
ession is positively wounded. 
 
    GRANT 

  Well, where's the fun in that? 
 
    VOLUNTEER 
  It looks a little distorted, but Idon't thin k th at's  
  the computer. 
 
    ELLIE 
   (shakes her head) 
  Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments. 

   (to Grant) 
  Velociraptor? 
 
    GRANT 
  Yes.  Good shape, too. 
 Five, six feet high.  I'm 
  guessingnine feet long.  Look at the -- 
 
 He points to part of theskelet
on, butwhenhis finger touches  
 the screen the computer BE EPS athim 
and the image change
s. He pulls  
 his hand back, as if it shockedhim. 
 
    VOLUNTEER 
  What's you do? 
 
    ELLIE 
  He touchedit.  Dr. Grant is not machine compatible. 
 
    GRANT 

  They've got it in for me. 
 
 The Volunteer LAUGHS and touches 
a different part of the screen,  
 w hich brings the original image back
. Grant continues, but doesn't get  
 as close. 
 
    GRANT 
  Look atthehalf-moon shaped bone in the wrist. No  
  wonder thes e guys learned tofly. 

 
 The group laughs. Grant is surprised. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Now, seriously.  Showof the hands.  How many of you 
  have read my book? 
 

 Everyonestops laughing and looks away. Ellie raises her hand  
 supportively. So does 
the Volunteer, Grant sighs. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Great.  Well maybe dinosaur
s have more in common with 
  present-day birds than rept
il es.  Look  atthe public  
  bone -- it's turned backwa
rds, just like a bird.  The  
  vertebrae -- full of hollow
s and air sacs, just like a  
  bird.  Eventheword raptor means"bird of prey". 
 

 The kid steps forwardand look
s at the computer skeleton  
 critically.  
 
    KID 
  Thatdoesn't look veryscary. More like a six-foot  
  turkey. 
 
 Everyo n esort of draws in  th
eir breath and steps aside,  
 revealing the KID, standing alone. Grantturns to theKid,lowers his  

 sunglasses, andstaresat him like 
he just came from another planet. 
 
 Grant strolls over tothe KID , pu ts his arms aroundhis  
 shoulders in a fr iendlyway. 
 
    GRANT 
  Try to imagin e yo u rselfin  th e Ju rassic Period. 
   (or) 
  Try to imagine yourselfin theCretaceous Period. 

 
 Ellie rolls her eyes. 
 
    ELLIE 
   (under her breath) 
  Here we go. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  You'd getyour first look atthesix-foot turkeyas you 

  move into a clearing.  Bu
t raptor,he knew youwere  
  there a long time ago.  He moves like a bird; lightly,   
  bobbing hishead, Andyou keep still, because you think  
  maybe his visual acuity's based onmovement,like a T- 
  rex, and he'll lose you if 
you don'tmove.  Butno. Not  
  VELOCIRAPTOR. You stare at him, andhe just stares  
  back. That's whentheattackcomes - - not from the  
  front, no, from the side, fr
omthe other two raptors you  
  didn't even know were there. 

 
 Grant walks around the Kid. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see, he uses  
  coordinated attack patterns, and he's out in force  
  today. And he slashesat you withthis --  

 
 He takes the claw from his pocket
andholds it at th e fron t of  
 the raptor's three-toedfoot. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  - - a six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, onthe 
  middle toe. They don'tbother tobite the jugular, like  
  a lion, theyjust slash here, here -- 
 
 He points to theKid's chest andthigh. 

 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  - - or maybe across th e belly, spilling your in testin es.  
  Point is, you're alive whenthey start to eatyou.  
  Whole thing took aboutfour seconds. 
 
 The Kid is on the verge if tears. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 

  So, you know,tryto show a little respect. 
 
 And with that he walks back ac
ross the camp, returning to his  
 skeleton. Ellie hurries 
to catch upwithhim. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Youknow , if you really  wanted to scare the kid you  
  could've just pulled a gun onhim. 
 

    GRANT 
  Yeah, I know,you know...kids. You want tohave one of  
  those? 
 
    ELLIE 
  Well, not one of those,well yeah, a possibly one at 
  some pointcould be agood th
ing.  What's so wrong with  
  kids? 
 

    GRANT 
  Oh, Ellie, lo ok.  They're 
noisy, they're messy, they're  
  sticky, they're expensive. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Cheap, cheap, ch eap. 
 
    GRANT 
  They smell. 

 
    ELLIE 
  Oh mygod, they do 
not! They don't smell. 
 
    GRANT 
  Theydo smell.  Some of
 them smell.. babies smell. 
 

    ELLIE 
  Alright, the one on the ai
rplane had an accident, but 
  usually babies don't smell. 
 
    GRANT 
  They know very little about the Jurassic Period they 
  know less about the Cretaceous. 
 
    ELLIE 
  The what? 

 
    GRANT 
  The Cretaceous. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Anything else, you oldfossil? 
 
    GRANT 
  Yeah,plenty. Some of them can'twalk! 

 
    ELLIE 
  It frustrates me so much that I love you, thatI need to 
  strangle you right now! 
 
 Ellie playfully takes Grant's hat 
offand giveshim a tight hug.  
 They kiss. 
 
 A strange wind seems to be whippingup.  Grant andEllie look  

 around, confused.  Thewind is getting stronger, blowing dirt and sand 
 everywhere, filling in everything
 they've dug out, blowing the  
 protective canvasses off. Now ther
e's a more familiar ROAR, and they  
 look up and see it - - 
 
 - - a hugehelicopter, descending on  the camp. 
 
    ELLIE 
   (to the volunteers) 

  Get some canvasses and cove
r anything that's exposed! 
 
 Grant's already on it, trying to desperately to protect the 
 skeleton he's excavating.  He look
s up at thehelicopter and SHOUTS, 
 shaking his fist. 
 
 
 CUT TO: 
 

 
9  EXT BASECAMP DAY 
 
 Down at the base camp, the helicopter has landed. ThePILOT is  
 already out, waiting asGRANT comes down from the mountaintop like  
 Moses steaming.  Grant gestureswild
ly at him to turn the chopperoff. 
 

 The pilot points timidly to a mobile home across the camp.   
 Grant runsto thetrailer. 
 
 
10  EXT TRAILER DAY 
 
 The door to thetrailer SLAPS open, and GRANT storms in. 
 
    GRANT 
  Whatthehell do youthink you'redoing in here? 

 
 The trailer serves as the dig's office.  There are several long  
 wooden tables set up, every inch co
vered withbone specimens that are  
 n eatly laid ou t,tagged, an d labeled. 
 
 Farther along are ceramic dishes 
and crocks, soaking otherbones  
 in acid andvinegar. 
 
 There's olddusty furniture at 
one end of the trailer, and a 
 refrigerator.  A man roots around in the refrigerator, his back to us.   
 GRUMBLING aboutthe conten
tswhich are mostly beer. 
 
 His handfalls across abottle of
 expensive champagne in the  
 back. 
 
    MAN 
  Ah hah! 
 

 He pulls it out- the cork POPS. 
 
 The Man turns around.  JOHN HAMM
OND, seventy-ish, issprightly  
 as hell, wit h bright , shining eyes that  say "Follow me!" 
  
 Grant stares incredulously at 
the Man,holding his champagne  
 bottle without an invitation. 
 
    GRANT 

  Hey, wewere saving that! 
 
    HAMMOND 
  For today, I guarantee it. 
 
    GRANT 
  Andwho inGod's name do you think you are....? 
 
    HAMMOND 

  John Hammond. And Iam delighted tofinally meet you  
  in person Dr Grant. 
 
 Grant is strucksilent. He 
shakeshis hand, staring dumbly. 
 
    GRANT 
  Mr. - - Hammond? 

 
 Hammond looks around the trailer 
approvingly, at the enormous  
 amount ofwork the bones represent. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  I can see my fifty thousand ayearas beenwell spent. 
 
 The door SLAPS open again andEL
LIE comes in, just as pissed off  
 as Grant was. 
 

    ELLIE 
  Okay, who's the jerk? 
 
    GRANT 
  Uh,this is our paleobotanist,Dr Ellie..... 
 
    ELLIE 
  Sattler. 
 

    Grant 
  Dr Sattler. Ellie, this is Mr. HAMMOND. 
   (in case she didn't catch it) 
  John Hammond. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Did I say jerk? 
 
    HAMMOND 

  I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm ina hurry. 
  Will you have a wee bit of a drinknow andthen? 
 
 Hammond begins to walk in to th ekitchen, makinghimself at home.  
 Ellie follows him tries to help. 
 Grant settles behind the table. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  Come along then, don't let it get warm! 
   (expansively) 

  Come on in, both ofyou.  Sit down. 
 
 As Hammond  moves,they notice he walks with a slight limp and  
 uses a cane - - forbalance or style, it'shard to saywitch. 
 
    ELLIE 
  I have samples all over thekitchen.   
   (she takes some stones out of oneof the glasses) 
 

    HAMMOND 
  Come along.  Iknow my way around akitchen. Come 
  along. 
 
 Ellie goes aroundtowards Grant. 
 She grabs abottle of water.   
 They look at each other, really ab
ack by this guy's br
avado, and site 
 down.  Hammond dries the glasses. 

 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  Well now, I'll get right to the poin t.  I like you.  
  Both of you.  Icantell instantly with people; it 's a gift. 
   (new subject) 
  I own an island. Off the coast of Costa Rica.  I leased  
  it from thegovernment andspent th
e last fiveyears setting up a kind 
  of biolog ical preserve downthere.
Really spectacular.  Spared no  
  expense. It makes theone I had in
 Kenya look like a pettingzoo. No 
  doubt t hat  sooner or lat er our at t ract ions will send (drive the) kids  

  right out oftheir minds. 
 
    GRANT 
  And what are those? 
 
    ELLIE 
  Small versions of adults, honey. 
 
 He gives her a dirty look. 

 
    HAMMOND 
  Not just kids -- for everyone. We're going toopen 
  nextyear. Unless the lawyers kill me first.  Idon't 
  care for lawyers. You? 
 
    GRANT 
  I, uh,don'treally knowany.  We- - 
 

    HAMMOND 
  Well, I'm afraid I do.  Th
ere's one,a particular pebble 
  in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  Hesays they  
  insist on outside opinions. 
 
    GRANT 
  Wh at kin d of opin ion s? 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Not to put a fine point on 
it, your kind.  Let's face  
  it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If  
  I could justget you two to 
sign offon the park - - you  
  know, givea wee testimonial - - Icould get back on  
  schedule - - 
   (he Americanizes him pronunciation) 
  - -schedule. 
 
    ELLIE

11  EXT CAFE DAY 
 
 DENNISNEDRY is in his lat e t hirt ies, a big guy wit h a const a nt  
 smile that could either be laughing 
with you or at you, you cannever 
 tell.  He sits at atable in fron t 
of aCentral American cafe, eating  
 breakfast 

 
 Another Legend: 
 SAN JOSE,COSTA RICA 
 
 Nedry looks up and sees a man get out of a taxi - - LEWIS  
 (Louis)DODGSON,fiftyish,wearing a large straw hat andlooking almost  
 too much lik e an American tourist. 
 Dodgson clutches as attaché case 
 close to him andscans the cafefurtively. 
 Nedry laughs, shakeshis head, and waves tohim. 

 
    NEDRY 
  Dodgson! 
 
 Dodgson hurries over to thetable. 
 
    DODGSON 

   (as he sites) 
  You sh ouldn' t use my name. 
 
    NEDRY 
  Dodgson, Dodgson. 
   (loud) 
  We got Dodgson here!  See,
 nobody cares. Nice hat. 
  What areyou trying to look like, a secret agent? 
 
 Dodgson ignores that,sets his a
ttaché case downnext to the  
 table, and slides it towards Nedry, 
 
    DODGSON 
  Seven fifty. 
 
 Nedry smiles and pulls the 
attachécloser to him. 
 
    DODGSON (cont'd) 
  On delivery, fifty thou sand more for ever viable embryo. 

  That's onepoint five million.  Ifyou get all fifteen  
  species off the island. 
 
    NEDRY 
  Oh, I'll get 'em all. 
 
    DODGSON 
  Remember - -viable embryos. They're nouse to us if 
  they don't survive. 

 
    NEDRY 
  How am I supposedtotransportthem? 
 
 Dodgson pulls an ordinary can of
 shaving cream from a shoulder  
 bag he carries and setsit on the table. 
 
    DODGSON 
  The bottom screws op
en; it's cooled and  
  compartmentaliz ed inside.  
Theycan even check it if  
  theywant. Press the top. 
 
 Nedry presses thetop of the can and real shaving cream comes  
 out. He grins, impressed.  While 
Dodgson talks,Nedry looks aroundfor  
 somewhere to wipe the shaving cream 
and ends up dumping it on top of  
 someone's Jell-O on a de
ssert tray next to him. 
 
    DODGSON (cont'd) 

  There's enough coolant 
gas f or thirty-sixhours. 
 
 Nedry looks at the can. 
 
    NEDRY 
  What?  No menthol? 
 

    DODGSON 
  Mr Nedry,Mr Nedry. The em
bryos have to be backhere  
  in San Joseby then. 
 
    NEDRY 
  That's up to yourguy on the boat. Seven o'clock  
  tomorrow night, at the east 
dock.Make surehe got it  
  right. 
 
    DODGSON 

  I waswondering, howare you planningto beat the  
  security? 
 
    NEDRY 
  I got an eighteen minute wi
ndow. Eighteen minutes, and 
  your company catches up 
on ten years of research. 
 
 A WAITER arrives and pu tsthecheck down onthe table, between  
 them. Nedry looks down at it 
pointedly, then up atDodgson. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  Don't get ch eep on me Dodgson . 
 
 Dodgson rolls his eyesand picks up the check. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  That was Hammond's mistake. 
 

 
 
13  EXT OPEN SEA DAY 
 
 A helicopter, "IN-GENCONSTRUCTI
ON" emblazoned onthe side,  
 skims low over the 
shimmering Pacific. 
 
 
14  EXT HELICOPTER DAY 

 
 GRANT,ELLIE, GENNARO andMALCOLM are huddled in the back of the  
 chopper; HAMMOND is in the front with the PILOT. 
 
 There are two other passengerswa
s well -- DONAL D GENNARO, the 
 lawyer from the ambermine, nowdre
ssed in safari clot
hes, everything  
 straight from Banana Republic.  The other Dr.IAN MALCOLM, fortyish,  
 dressed all in black, with a snakes
kin boots and sunglasses. Malcolm,  
 whofinds it hardto take his eyes offEllie, leans over andSHOUTS  

 over the engine whine. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  So youtwodig up dinosaurs? 
 
    GRANT 
  Try to! 

 
 Malcolm laughs, finding this very amusing,which confuses Grant.   
 Hammond tu rns around annoyed. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  You'll haveto getuse to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from 
  a deplorable excess ofpersonality, especially for a  
  mathematician! 
 
    MALCOLM 

  Chaotician, actu
ally! Chaotician! 
 
 Hammond SNORTS,not evenbothering to cover his contempt for  
 Malcolm. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  John doesn't subscribe to Chaos,particularly what it  
  has to say abouthis 
little science project! 
 

    HAMMOND 
  Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining 
  these concerns of yours about this island! 
 
    MALCOLM 
  I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because ofthe 
  behavior of the sy
stemin phase space! 
 
 Hammond justwaves him off. 

 
    HAMMOND 
  A load, if Imay sayso. of fashionable numbercrunching, that¹s all it is! 
 
    MALCOLM 
   (poking at Hammond's knee) 
  John, John. 
 
    HAMMOND 

   (pushing him away) 
  Don't do that! 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Dr. Grant,Dr. Sattler -- you'veheard ofChaos Theory? 
 
    ELLIE 
   (shaking  her head) 
  No. 

 
    MALCOLM 
  No?  Non-linear equations? Strange attractions? 
   (again, she shrugs) 
  Dr. Sattler,I refuse tobelieve that you are not  
  familiar with the concept of attraction! 
 

 Grant just rolls his eyes as Malc
olm gives her an oily grin,but  
 Ellie smiles, enjoying Grant's jealous
y.  Hammond turns to Genna roand  
 gives him adirty look. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  I bring scientists--you bring a rock star. 
 
 Hammond looks out the windshield, andCLAPS his hands excitedly. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  There it is! 
 
 Up ahead, the others see it. 
 
 ISLA NUBLAR.  It's a smallish island ,completely ring ed by thick  
 clouds thatgive it a lush, mysterio
usfeel.  The PILOT pulls up over a 
 spot in theclouds andstartsto descend, fast. 
 
   HAMMOND (cont'd) 

  Bad wind shears!  Wehave to
 drop pretty fast!  Hold on, 
  this can bea little thrilling! 
 
 Th eh elicopter drops like a ston e.
 Outside the windows,they  
 can see cliff walls racing by, unco
mfortably close.  Theybounce like  
 hell, hitting windup and down drafts. 
 
 Only Hammond st ill feels chat t y. 
 

   HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  We're planning an airstrip
!  Onpilings, extending out 
  in to the ocean twelve th ousand
feet!  Like La Guardia,  
  only  a lot safer!  Whatdo you think? 
 
 They don't answer, ju
st hold on.As theynear the ground, a  
 luminous white cloud cross appears 
below them, a landing pad shining  
 throughthe Plexiglas bubble in
 the floor of the chopper. 
 

 The cross grows rapidly larger 
as the chopperplummets,but a  
 sudden updraft catches them andthey
 bounceskyward for a momentthen  
 drop again,even fasterif possible, before landingwith a hard BUMP. 
 
 
14A  EXT HELICOPTER LANDING PAD DAY 
 
 The chopper plummetsand finally
 lands.  Oneof the workers  
 opens the door and the groupgets 
out. Hammond looks out, proudly. 
 
 
15  EXT HILLTOP DAY 
 
 Two large,open-top jeeps ROAR 
downthehilltop away from the  
 landing cross as thehelicopter en
gines WHINEback to life and the  
 rotors startto spin again. 

 
 ELLIE, GRANT, andMALCOLM hold ontight inthe front jeep,  
 HAMMONDand GENNARO are in the rear
 jeep.  Both carshaveDRIVERS. 
 
 Theypass th rough an enormous gate in  a th irty foot high fence,  
 which is closed behindthem by two PARK ATTENDANTS. 
 
 There are large electric al insu
lators onthefences, warning  
 lights that strobe importantly and cl
ear signs -- "ELECTRIFIED FENCE!  
 10,000 VOLTS!" 

 
 IN THE REAR JEEP, 
 
 Gennaro regards the fences critically. 
 
    GENNARO 
  The full f if ty mile of  perimeter f ence are in place? 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Andthe concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking  
  systems. Donald, dearboy, do tryto relax and enjoy  
  yourself. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a  
  weekend excursion,this is a serious investigation of  
  the stabil ity  of the island. Your investors,w hom I  
  represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from  

  now, if they - - 
   (gesturesto Grant, Ellie , and Malcolm) 
  - -aren't convinced.  I'm notconvinced. AndI can shut 
  you down John. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Forty-eight hours from no
w, I'll be accepting your  
  apologies. Now get out of 
theway.  So Icansee them! 
 

 He shovesGennaro aside, to get a clear view of Grant, Ellie,  
 and Malcolm. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  I wouldn'tmiss this for theworld. 
 
 The jeeps wind their wa
y along a mountain road. 
 
 IN THE LEAD JEEP, 

 
 Ellie stares off to the right, fascinated by the thick tropical  
 plant life aroundthem.  She tilts her head, asif something'swrong  
 with this picture. 
 
 She reaches out and grabs hold of
a leafy branch as theydrive  
 by,TEARING it from the tree. 

 
 IN THE REAR JEPP,  
 
 Hammond watching Grant, signals tohis Driv er . 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Just stop here, st
ophere.  Slow,slow. 
 
 He slows down, thenstops.  So does thefront jeep. 
 

 IN THE FRONT JEEP, 
 
 Ellie stares at th e leaf,amazed, runningherhand lightlyover  
 it. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Alan - - 
 
 But Grant'snot payingattention. He's staring too, outthe  

 other side of the jeep. 
 
 Grant notices that several of
 the tree trunks are leafless -  
 just as thick as the othe
r trees, butgray and bare. 
 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
   (still staring at the leaf) 
  This shouldn't be here. 
 

 Grant twists in his seatas th
e jeepstops and looks at oneof  
 the gray tree trunks.  Riveted, he slowly stands up in his seat, as if  
 to get closer.  He moves to the to
p of the seat, practically on his  
 tiptoes. 
 
 He raises his head, looking upthe length ofthe trunk.  He  
 looks higher. 
 
 And higher. 

 
 And higher. 
 
 That's no tree trunk. That's a 
leg. Grant's jaw drops,his 
 head falls all the way back, andhe
 looks evenhigher, above thetree 
 line. 
 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
   (still looking at the leaf) 

  This species of vermiform 
wasbeen extinct since the  
  cretaceous period.  This thing - -  
 
 Grant,never tearing his eyes from
the brachiosaur, reaches over  
 and grabs Ellie's head, turn
ing it t ofa ce t he animal. 
 
 She sees it, anddrops the leaf. 

 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
  Oh -- my -- God. 
 
 Grant lets out a long,  sharp,  HAH- a combination laugh and  
 shout of joy. 
 
 He gets ou t of th e jeep, an d Ellie fo llows.  Gran t poin ts toth e  
 thing and manages toputtogether 
his first words since itsappearance: 
 

    GRANT 
  THAT'S A DINOSAUR! 
 
 - - a dinosaur.  Chewing the branches.  Technically,  it's a  
 brachiosaur, of the sauropod fa
mily, but we've always called it  
 brontosaurus.  ItCRUCHES the bran
ch in its mouth,which is some  
 thirty-fivefeet up offthe ground
,at the end of its long, arching  
 neck.  It stares down at thepeople
 in the car with a pleasant, stupid  
 gaze. 

 
 Ellie looks up atthe sauropods in wonder. 
 
 They've pretty light onthei
r feet -a far cry from the  
 sluggish, lumbering brutes
 we would have expected. 
 
 Hammond gets out ofhis jeep and 
comes back to join them.  He  
 looks like a proud pare
nt showingoff the kid. 
 

 Ian Malcolm looks at Hammond, am
azed, andwith an expression  
 that is a mixture of ad
miration and rapprochement. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  You did it. You craz yson of a bitch,youdid it. 
 
 Grant and Ellie continue walking,following thedinosaur. 
 
    GRANT 

  The movement! 
 
    ELLIE 
  T he - - agility. You're right! 
 
 In their amazement, Grant andEl
lie talk rightover each other. 
 
    GRANT 
  Ellie, we can tearupthe ru
le book on cold-bloodedness.   
  It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong! This is awarm-blooded  
  creature. They're totally wrong. 
 
    ELLIE 
  They were wrong.  Case cl
osed.  This thing doesn't live 
  in a swampto support it's bodyweightfor God's sake! 
 

 Several of the topbranches ar
e suddenly RIPPED away. Another  
 sauropod, reaching fora branch 
high above their heads, stands  
 ef f ortlessly on itshind  legs. 
 
    GRANT 
   (to Hammond) 
  Thatthing's got awhat, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot  
  neck? 
 
    HAMMOND 

  The brachiosaur?  Thirty. 
 
  Grant and Ellie continue towalk . 
 
    GRANT 
  - - andyou're going tosit there and try to tell me it  
  can pu sh blood up a th irty-foot neck with out afour-chambered heartand  
  get around like that?!  Like that!? 
   (to Hammond) 

  This is lik e a knockoutpunchforwarm-bloodedness. 
 
    HAMMOND 
   (proudly) 
  We clocked the T-rex at thirty-twomiles an hour. 
 
    ELLIE 
  You've got a T-rex!? 
   (to Grant) 

  He's got aT-rex! A T-rex!  He said he's- - 
 
    GRANT 
  Say again? 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Yes,we have a T-rex. 
 
 Grant feelsfaint. He sits down onthe ground. 

 
    ELLIE 
  Honey, putyourhead between your knees, and breathe. 
 
 Hammond  walks in f ront of  themand  looks out. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Dr. Grant,my dear Dr. Sattler.  Welcome to Jurassic 
  Park. 

 
 Theyturn and look atthe view again.  It's beautiful vista, 
 reminiscent of an African plain.  A 
whole herdof dinosaurs crosses the  
 plain, maybe a hundred thatwe
 see in a quick glance alone. 
 
    GRANT 
  Ellie, they're absolutely - 
- they'removing in herds.   

  Theydo move in herds! 
 
    ELLIE 
  We were right! 
 
    GRANT 
   (to Hammond) 
  How did you do it?! 
   (or) 
  How did you dothis?! 

 
    HAMMOND 
  I'll show you.  
 
 Finally, wenotice Gennaro, who was sort of faded into the  
 background wh ile the others reacted.  He's just starin g, a look of  
 absolute rapture on his face. 
 
 He speaks in avoice that is hushed and reverent.  

 
    GENNARO 
  We are going to make a fortunewith this place.

 unto itself,with smoked window
sand its own perimeter fence. 
 
 The third structur e isn't really a building at all, butthe

20 IN THE FILM, 
 
 the screen-Hammond is joined 
by another figure, this one  
 animated.  MR. DNA is a cartoon 
character, ahappy-go-lucky double- 
 helix strand of recombinant DNA. 
Mr.DNA jumps down onto the screen- 
 Hammond's head and slides downhis nose. 
 

    HAMMOND 
  Well!  Mr. DN A! Where'd you come from? 
 
    MR. DNA 
  From yourblood!  Just one 
drop of yourblood contains  
  billions of strands of DNA,
 the building blocks of lif e!

22 IN THE FILM, 
 
 Mr.DNA has taken over the show,and is speaking totheaudience  
 from the screen. 
 
    MR. DNA 
  A D NA stran d like me is a blu eprin t fo r bu ildin g a  
  livin g th in g!  And sometimes an imals th atwen textin ct  

  millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their  
  blueprints behind forus to find! We justhadto know  
  where to look! 
 
 The screen image changes from anim
ated to anature- photography  
 look.  It's an extreme close-up of 
a mosquito, its fangs suck the deep 
 int o some animals flesh, it s body pulsing and engorgingwit h blood it 's  
 drinking. 
 

    MR. DNA (cont'd) 
  A hundredmillion years ago,
there were mosquitoes, just 
  like to day. An d, ju st like 
today, they fed onthe blood  
  of animals.  Even dinosaurs! 
 
 The camera races backto show th
e mosquito is perched on top of  
 a giant animated brachiosaur. 
 
 The image changes, toanother 
close-up, this one of atree  
 branch, itsbark glistening with gold
en sap. Mr. DNA leaps onthesap. 
 
    MR. DNA (cont'd) 
  Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur, the mosquito would  
  land on abranch of a tree, and getstuck inthe sap! 
 
 The engorged mosquito lands in th
e tree sap, andgets stuck.  So  
 is Mr.DNA. He tugs his legs, but they stay stuck. 
 

    MR. DNA 
  WHOA! 
 
 Now the tree sap flows over them
,covering up Mr. DNA and the  
 mosquito completely. Mr.DNA SH
OUTS frominside the tree sap. 
 
    MR. DNA (cont'd) 

  After a long time, thetree sap would gethardand  
  become fossilized, just like 
a dinosaur bone, preserving  
  the mosquito in side!

 The place buzzes withactivity.  
Everywhere,there are piles of  
 amber, tagged an d labeled with  SCIENTISTSin  wh ite coats examin in g it

 One SCIENTIST mov es a complicated dril l apparatusnex tto the  
 chuck of amber with a 
fossilized mosquito inside
 and BORES intothe 
 side of it. MR.DNA escapes through the drill hole as theScientist  
 moves theamber onto a microscope
 and peers through the eyepiece. 
 
    MR. DNA (O.S.) 
  This fossilized tree sap--which we call amber -  
  waited millions of years,with th emosquito in side -  

  until Jurassic Park's scientists came along! 
 
 
24 THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE 
 
 We see thegreatly enlarged im
age of a mosquito through the

    MR. DNA (O.S.) 

  Using sophisticated tec

  preserved blood from the mosquito,  
  and - - 
 
 A long  needle is inserted  throug h the amber, into the thorax of   
 the mosquito, and makes an extraction. 
 
    MR. DNA (cont'd) 
  - -Bingo! Dino DNA! 

 
 Mr.DNA jumps down in front ofDNA data as it races by  at  
 headache speed.  He holds his head, dizzied by  it. 
 
    MR. DNA (cont'd) 
  A full DNA strand contains th ree billion genetic codes!  
  If we looked at screens 
like these once a second for  
  eight hoursa day, it'd take two years to look at the

25B ON THE V.R.  DISPLAY 
 

 we see an actual DNA strand, except it has a big hole in the  
 center,where the vital information is missing. Mr.DNA bounds into  
 the frame,carrying a butch of letters in onehand. 
 
 He puts it in the gap and turns back against it, GRUNTING as he  
 shoves into place.

  Nowwe can make a baby dinosaur! 
 

 
26 IN THE AUDIENCE 
 
 The scientist look at 
each other,not sure. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  All this hassome dramatic music - - da dum da dum da  
  dum dum -- march orsometh

  and the tour moves on- -  

 
 He throws a switch andsafety 
bars appear out of nowhere and  
 drop over their seats,CLICKING into place. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  For your own safety ! 
 

 The row ofseats moves out ofthe auditorium. 
 
 
27 INTHALLWAY DAY 
 
 The row ofseats moves slowly pa
st a row ofdouble-panned glass  
 windowbeneath a large sign that reads  
 "GENETICS/FERTILIZATIO
N/HATCHERY." Inside, TECHNICIANS workat  
 microscopes. 
 

 In the backis a sect ionent irely lit  by blue ult raviolet  light . 
 
 Mr.DNA VOICE continues over a speaker in each seat. 
 
    MR. DNA (O.S.) 
  Our fertilization department is where the dinosaur DNA  
  takes the place of the DN
A in u nfertilized emu  or  
  ostrich eggs - - and then it
's on to the nursery,where  
  we welcome the dinosaurs back into the world! 

 
 GENNAROhas a wondrous grinplas
tered onhis face, just loving  
 everything now. 
 
    GENNARO 
  This is overwhelming, John.  Arethese characters  
  (people) animatronics? 
 
    HAMMOND 

  No,we don't have anyanimatronics here. These are the  
  real miracle work
ers ofJurassic Park. 
 
 GRANT, ELLIE, and MALC OLM are 
frustrated, leaning forward,  
 straining against the safety bars for a better look.  Butthe cars keep 
 going. 
 
    GRANT 
  Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular  

  mitosis?!? 
 
    ELLIE 
  C an'twe see theunfertilized host eggs?! 
 
 But the cars are already moving 
onto another set ofwindows,  
 which give a glimpse into what looks like a control room. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Shortly, sh ortly.... 
 
    MR. DNA (O.S.) 
  Our control room contains so
me ofthe most sophisticated 
  automation ever attempted  
  in - - 
 

 Grant strains to look back in tothe labs, bu tthe cars movepast  
 again, no intention of slowing down. 
 
    GRANT 
  Can't you stop thesethings?! 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Sorry!  It'skind of a ride! 
 
    GRANT 

   (to Malcolm) 
  Let's get outta here! 
 
 The two of them team up onthesafety bars.  Grant shoves his  
 all the waybackwith one foot and 
Malcolm does the same.  They stand  
 up andhead for the door of the hatchery. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Hey!  You can't do that! 

 
 Too late.  Ellie slips outfrom underher safety bar too  
 and stomps right across Gennaro's seat. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Can they do that? 
 
 They reachthe door tothehatchery. Granttries to shoveit  
 open, but justTHUDS into it. He rattles thehandle, but the door  

 won't bu dge as it's on 
a securitykey-card system. 
 
 HAMMONDsteps up and 
takes his glasses off. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Relax, Donald, relax.  Th
ey're scientists, Theyought 
  to be curious. 
   (he steps up to the code box) 
  It's a retinal scanner. 

 
 He pushesvarious code numbers. Thedoor opens. He steps  
 aside, and the group eage
rly goes up the stairs. 
 
 
28 INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS - DAY 
 
 GRANT runs up the stairs. MALCOLM andELLIE eagerly try toget  
 a look at the lab.  HA
MMOND and GENNARO come up 
and join Grantat the  
 door. 
 
    GENNARO 
  John,we -- what I'm just saying.... 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Relax Donald, relax. They'r
e scientists. Theyought to 

  be curious. 
 
 Hammond reaches thedoor,  Grant tries to pry it open. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  Dr. Grant, just a minute, just a minute, 
   (or) 
  Dr. Grant, just a moment, dear boy. 
  (he pushes the co
de; the door opens) 
  Remember what Samuel Johnsonsaid. 

   (they step into the cubicle) 
  "Curiosity is one of thepermanentand certain 
  characteristics of 
a vigorous intellect!" 
   (the second door opens) 
  Right!  Come along. 
 
 
INT HATCHERY/NURSERY DAY 
 

 Thehatc hery  is a v ast,open room,bathed in infrared light.   
 Longtables runthe length of th e place, all covered with eggs,their  
 pale outlines obscuredby hissing lo
w mist that's all through the room. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Come on in. 
 
 HAMMONDtakes offhis hat and ha
nds it on eof the technicians. 
 

 HENR Y WU, late twenties, Asian-American, wearing a white lab  
 coat worksat a nearby
 table, making notes. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  Good day, Henry. 
 
    WU 
  Oh, good day, Sir. 
 

 GRANT goes to a round, openwith
various eggs under a strong  
 light. 
 
 One of theeggs makes strong mo
vements - arobotic arm steadies  
 the shell. 
 
    GRANT 
  My God!  Look! 
 

 Hammond,Ellie, and Malcolm jo
in him, as does Henry Wu. 
 
    WU 
  Ah, perfect timing!  I'd hope
d they'd hatchbefore I had  
  to go to the boat. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Henry,whydidn't youtell me?  you know I insist on 
  being herewhen they're born. 
 
 Hammond puts on a pair of plasticgloves. 
 
 The eggbegins to crack. The 
robotic arm moves away....a BABY  
 DINOSAURtries to getout, just it
shead sticking out ofthe shell. 
 
 Hammond reaches down and carefully breaks away egg fragments,  
 helping thebaby dinosaur  out of its shell. 

 
    HAMMOND 
  Come on, then, out you come. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  T hey imprint on the first living creature they come in 
  contact with. Thathelps them totrust me.  I've been  
  present forthe birth ofever
y  animal on this Island.   
  Just look at that. 

 
    MALCOLM 
  Surely not the ones that
 have bredin thewild? 
 
    WU 
  Actually, they can't breed in thewild.  P opulation  
  control is one of our security precautionshere.  There  
  is no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park. 
 

 Grant and Ellie exchange a look.  She manages not to smile. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  How do you knowtheycan't breed? 
 
    WU 
  Because all the animals in J urassic Park are females.    
  (I've) We engineered them thatway. 
 

 Hammond keeps his attention trained on th enew dinosaur. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  There you are.  Out you come. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Oh my God. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Could Ihave a tissue please? 
 
    WU 
  Right away(certainly). Coming rightup. 
 
 The animal is nowfree, Hammondsets in doncarefully  next to  
 its sh ell.  Gran t picks itu p an dh o lds it in  th e palm of h is han d,  

 under the incubator's heat light. 
 
    GRANT 
  Blood temp erature feels like high eighties. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Wu? 
 
    WU 
  Ninety-one. 

 
 Grant picksup the large, broken
 half-shell, butthe roboticarm  
 snatches itback out ofhis hand, and puts it down. 
 
    GRANT 
  Homoeothermic?  It holds thattemperature? 
   (to Wu) 
  In credible. 
 

 Malcolm is looking at Hammond, skeptical. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  But again,howdo you know they're all female?  Does 
  someone go into the park and,uh - - liftupthe  
  dinosaurs' sk irts? 
 
    WU 
  We control their chromosomes.
  It's not that difficult.  
  All vert ebra t e embryosare inherent ly female anyway.  It takes an extra  
  hormone at the right developmenta
l stage tocreate a male, and we 
  simply deny them that. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Your silence intrigues me. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  John, the kind of control you're attempting is not  

  possible.  If there's one th
ing the history of evolution  
  has taughtus, it's thatlife will notbe contained.   
  Life breaksfree.  It expandsto new territories.  It  
  crashes throughbarriers. Painfully, maybe even..  
  dangerously, but and...well, there it is. 
 
 Ellie listens to 
him, impressed. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Watch herhead - support herhead. 
 
 Grant, ignoring the others, picksup thebabydinosaur, and  
 holds it  onthe palm ofhis ha nd,under the incubat or'sheat  light .  He  
 spreads the tiny animal out ontheback of hishand and delicately runs  
 his finger over its tail, counting th
e vertebrae.  A look ofpuzzled  
 recognition crosses hisface. 

 
    WU 
  You're implying that agrou
p of composed entirely of  
  females will breed? 
 
    MALCOLM 
  I'm simply saying thatlife - - finds a way. 
 
    ELLIE 
  "You can'tcontrol anything."  I agree with that.  I  

  like that.  
 
 She wa lks over t oMa lcolm, he smiles at  her, too wa rmly. 
 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
  You cantalk. I don'tk now howto say it. You're just  
  articulate.  You say everythingthat I think,that I  
  feel.  It's exciting. 
   (or) 

  I find it so exciting.  It's exciting that you can't  
  control life, that you know - - 
   (or) 
  Youknow that, I find it terrifying. Life will always  
  find a way. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  That's right.  Will break through.  
 

    ELLIE 
  I get ah -- 
 
    MALCOLM 
  I know, it'svery exciting. 
 
    ELLIE 
  And scary. 
 

    MALCOLM 
  And scary. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Whenpeople try  to control things that it's outof their 
  power - - 
 
    MALCOLM 
  It's anti-nature. 

 
    ELLIE 
  Anti-nature. 
 
 Grant doesn't notice, as he's still obsessed with the infant  
 dinosaur, measurin g and weighing it on a nearby lab bench. He stops, a  
 st range look on his fa ce.  He knows what t hisanimal is - - but it   

 can't be. 
 
    GRANT 
   (dreading the answer) 
  What species is this? 
 
    WU 
  Uh - - it's aVelociraptor.  
 
 Grant and Ellie turn sl
owly and look at each 
other, then look at  
 Hammond, astonished. 
 
    GRANT 
  You bred raptors? 
 
 
29 EXT.RAPTOR PEN - DAY 
 
 Grant ch arges across the compound, 
afire in his eyes, ahead of  
 E LLIE , MALC OLM, and GE NNARO.  
HAMMONDstruggles to keep up. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Dr. Grant,Dr. Grant?Uh - -we plannedto show you th e 
  raptors later, after lunch. 
 
 But Grant has stoppedabruptlyne
xt to the Velociraptor pen,  
 which we recognize as the heavily fortified cage we someearlier, which  
 the San Quentin towers at one end. 

 
 Grant stands rightup against th
e fence, eyeswide, dyingfor a  
 glimpse. 
 
 HAMMOND catches up, slightly out of breath. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  D r. Grant -- as Iwas sayin g,we' ve laid ou t lu n ch fo r 
  you beforeyouhead out into thepark. Alejandro, our  

  gourmet chef - - 
 
    GRANT 
  What are they doing? 
 
 As theywatch, a giantcrane lowers something large down into  
 the middle of the jungle foliage insi
de the pen.  Something very large. 
 
 It's a steer.  They poorthin
g looksdisconcerted ashell,  
 helpless its in a harness, flailing its legs in theair. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Feeding them. 
   (moving along) 
  Alejandro is preparing a delightful meal for us.  A  
  Chilean sea bass, Ibelieve.  Shall we? 

 
 Grant goesup to the viewing de
ck.  The others follow, staring  
 as thesteer disappears into theshro
ud of foliage.  The line from the 
 crane hangs for a moment. 
 
 The jungle seems to grow very 
quiet. They all stare atthe  
 mot ionless crane line. It  jerks suddenly, like a fishing pole fina lly  
 getting anibble.  There's a pause - - 
 
 - - andthen a frenzy. The lin
e jerks everywhichway, the  
 jungle plants sway andSNAPfromsome frantic activitywithin,there is  
 a cacophony of GROWLING, of SNAPPING
, ofwet CRUNCHES that mean the  
 steer is literally being torn to pieces and is almost makes it worse  
 that we can' t see anything
 ofwhat's going on - - 
 
 - - andthen it's quiet again.  
The line jerks afew times, then  
 stops. Slowly the SOUND of  the jungle startsup again. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Fascinating anim
als, fascinating. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Oh my God. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Give time, they'll out draw
 the T-rex. Guarantee it. 
 
    GRANT 

  I want to see them. Canwe get closer? 
 
 E llie puts ahand onhis arm, like calm ing an overexcited child. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Alan, thesearen't bones anymore. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  We're - - still perfecting a viewing system. The 

  raptors seem to be abit resistantto integration into a 
  park setting. 
 
 A VOICE comes from behind them. 
 
    VOICE (O.S.) 
  Theyshould all be destroyed. 
 
 Theyturn and look 
at the man who spoke. 
 ROBERT MULDOON, the  
 grim-faced man whowas presentat 
the accident inthe beginning, is  
 fortyish, British. 
 
 He joins them andtakes his hat 
off.  When Muldoon talks,you  
 listen. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.Bit 
  of an alarmist, I'm afraid
, Buthe'sdealt with th e  
  raptors more than anyone. 
 
    GRANT 
   (introducing himself) 
  Alan Grant. Tell me, what 
kind ofmetabolism do th ey 
  have? What's their growth rate? 
   (or) 
  rate of growth. 

 
    MULDOON 
  They're lethal at eightmont
hs. And Ido lethal.  I've 
  h un ted most th in gs th at can hu nt you , bu t th ewayth ese  
  things move - - 
 
    GRANT 
  Fast for biped? 
 

    MULDOON 
  Cheetah speed.  Fifty,sixty 
miles per hour ifthey ever 
  got out in the open.  And 
they're astonishing jumpers. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Yes, yes, yes, which is wh
ywe take extreme precautions. 
  Theyviewing area belowuswill have eight-inch tempered  
  glass set inreinforced steel frames to -- 
 

    GRANT 
  Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like  
  theirs we assumed - - 
 
    MULDOON 
  They show extreme intellig
ence, even problem solving. 
  Especially the big one. We
 bred eight originally, but  
  when she came in, she took 
overthe pride and killed all  
  buttwo ofthe others. Th
at one - -when she looks at  
  you, you can see she'sthinking(or) working things  
  out.  She's the reason we 
have tofeed 'em like this.  
  Sh e h ad th em all attackin g 
thefences when the feeders  
  came. 
 
    ELLIE 
  The fencesare electrified, right? 
 
    MULDOON 

  Th at' s righ t.  Bu t th ey 
never attackthe same place  
  twice. They were testing the fences forweaknesses.   
  Systematically.  They remembered. 
 
 Behind them, the crane WHIRRSba
ck to life,  raising thecable  
 backup ou t of the raptor pen. 
The guestturn and stareas the end 
 portion of the cable becomes visibl
e.  The steer has beendragged  

 completely away, leaving only thetattered, bloody harness. 
 
 Hammond claps his hands togetherexcitedly. 
  
    HAMMOND 
  Who'shungry?  After you, my dear. 
 
 
30 INT. VISITOR CENTER PRESENTATIONROOM -DAY 
 

 HAMMOND, GRANT, ELLIE,MALCOLM, and GANNARO eatlunch at a long  
 table in thevisitor'
s center restaurant. 
 
 There is a large buffettable 
and two WAITERS to servethem. 
 
 The room is darkened and Hammond is showing slides ofvarious  
 scenes all aroundthem.  Hammond's own recorded voice describes current  
 and future featur es ofthe park 
while the slides flash artists'  
 renderings of all them. 

 
 The real Hammond turns and 
speaks over the narration. 
 
    HAMMOND 
 None of these attractionshave been finishedyet. The  
 park will open with thebasic tour you're aboutto take,  
 and then other rides will come on line after sixor  
 twelve months.  Absolutely spectacular designs.  Spared  
 no expense. 

 
 More slides CLICK past, a series 
ofgraphs dealing with profits,  
 attendanceand other fiscal projec
tions.  Donald Gennaro, who has  
 become increasingly friendly with Hammond, even giddy,grins from ear  
 to ear. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Andwe can charge anyt hingwewant!  Twothousand a day,  
  ten thousand a day --people will pay it! And then 

  there's themerchandising - - 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Dona ld, this parkwa snot  built  t o cart er only to t he  
  super rich. Everyone in 
theworld's got a rightto  
  enjoy these animals. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Sure, theywill, they will. 

   (laughing) 
  We'll ha ve a - - couponday or somet hing. 
 
 Grant looksdown, at the plate he
's eating from.  It's inthe  
 shape of the island itself.   He looks athis drinking cup.  It's got a  
 T-rex on it,and a splashyJurassicPark logo. 
 

 There are a stack offolded amus
ement park-style mapson the  
 table in front of Grant. He picks 
one up.  Boldly, across the top it  
 says,"Fly United to Jurassic Park!" 
 
    HAMMOND 
   (on tape) 
  - -from combined revenue streams for all three parks  
  should reach eightto nine billion dollars a year - -  
 
    HAMMOND 

   (to Gennaro) 
  That's conservative, of cour
se. There's no reason to  
  speculate wildly . 
 
    GENNARO 
  I've never been a richman. I hear it's nice. Is it 
  nice? 
 
 Ian Malcolm, whowas been watching the screenswith outright  

 contempt, SNORTS, as if he's finally had enough. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  The lack ofhumility before nature that's beendisplayed 
  here staggers me. 
 
 They all turn  and lookat him. 
 
    GENNARO 

  Thank you,Dr.Malcolm, but Ithink things area little 
  different than you andI feared. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Yes, Iknow.  They're alot worse. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Now, wait a second, we haven't even see thepark yet.   
  Let' s ju sthold ou t concern s un til -- 

   (or alt. version) 
  Wait  - we were invited to this island to evaluate the 
  safety conditions ofthepark, physical containment.  
  The theories that all simple systems havecomplex  
  behavior, that animals in
 azoo environmentwill  
  eventually begin to behave in anunp redictable f ashion  
  have nothing to do with that evaluation.  This is not  
  some exist ent ial furlough,t his is an on-sit e  
  inspection. You are a doctor. Do your job. You are  

  invalidating your ow n assessment. I'm sorry, John- - 
 
    HAMMOND 
  AlrightDonald, alright, but just let him talk. I want  
  to hear all viewpoints. I truly do. 
   (or) 
  I truly am. 

 
    MALCOLM 
  Don't you see the danger, John , inherent in wh atyou're  
  doing here?  Genetic power 
is themost awesome force  
  ever seen on this planet. 
 But youwield it like a kid  
  who's found his dad's gun. 
 
    MALCOLM GENNARO 
  If I may.... It is hardlyappropriate  
  to start hurling 

  Excuse me, excuse me - 
- generalizations before - - 
  I'll tell you. 
 
    MALCOLM (cont'd) 
  The problem with scientific 
power you've used is it  
  didn't require any disciplin
e to attain it.  You read  
  what others haddone and youtook thenext step. You  
  didn't earnthe knowledge yo
urselves, so you don'ttake  
  the responsibility for it. 
 You stoodon the shoulders  
  of geniusesto accomplish something as fast asyou  
  could, andbefore youknew whatyouhad, you patented 
  it, packages it, slappedin 
on a plastic lunch box, and  
  now y ou w antto sell it. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  You don't give us our due 
credit. Our scientists have  
  done things no one could ever do before. 
 

    MALCOLM 
  Your scientists were so preo
ccupied with whether or not  
  theycould thatthey didn't stopto think ifthey 
  should. Science can create pesticides, but it can't  
  tell us notto use them.  Science can make a nuclear  
  reactor, but it  can't tell usnotto build it ! 
 
    HAMMOND 
  But this is nature! Why not giv e an ex tinc t species a  

  second chance?! I mean,Condors.  Condors are on the  
  verge of extinction - - if 
I'd createda flock ofthem  
  on the island, youwouldn't be saying any of this! 
   (or) 
  have anything to say at all! 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Hold on - -this is nospecies thatwas obliterated by  
  deforestation or the building of a dam. Dinosaurshad  

  their shot. Nature sele
cted them for extinction. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  I don't understand this Lu
ddite attitude, especially  
  from a scientist. Howcoul
d we stand inthe light of  
  discovery and not act? 
 

    MALCOLM 
  There's nothing that
great about discovery. 
   (or) 
  What's so great aboutdi
scovery? It's aviolent,  
  penetrative act that scars wh
at it explores.  Whatyou  
  call discovery I call therape of thenatural world! 
 
    GENNARO 
  Please - - let'shear some
thing from the others. Dr. 
  Grant?  I am sorry - -Dr. Sattler? 

 
    ELLIE 
  The question is - -how much canyouknow about an  
  extinct ecosystem, and ther
efore, how couldyou assume  
  you can control it?  You haveplants righthere in this  
  building, for example, that 
are poisonous. You picked  
  them because they look pre
tty, butthese are aggressive  
  liv ing things that hav e no idea w hat century they 're  
  living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if  

  necessary. 
 
 Exasperated, Hammond turnsto Grant,who looks shell-shocked. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Dr. Grant, if there's one pe
rsonwho can appreciate all  
  of th is - - 
   (or) 
  What am I trying to do? 

 
 Bu t Gran t speaks qu ietly, really th rown by all of th is. 
 
    GRANT 
  I feel - - elated and -- frightened and - - 
   (starts over) 
  Theworld has just changed 
so radically.  We'reall  
  running tocatchup.  Idon't wantto jump to any  
  conclusions, but look -- 

 
 He leans forward, a look oftrue concern onhis face. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Dinosaurs an d man - -two species separatedby 65  
  million years of evolution - -havejust been su ddenly  
  thrown back into themix together.  How canwe have the  
  faintest idea ofwhat to expect? 
 

    HAMMOND 
  I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here  
  and defendme from these 
characters andtheonly one  
  I've got onmy side it the bloodsucking lawyer!? 
 
    GENNARO 
  Thank you. 

 
 One of theWAITERS whispers to Hammond. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Ah - -they're here. 
 
    GRANT 
  Who? 
 
A31 INT VISITOR'SCENTER LOBBY -DAY 

 
 HAMMOND, GRANT, ELLIE,MALCOLM, and GENNAROwalks out of the  
 restaurantand in tothe lobby ofthe 
visitor's center. They head down  
 the stairs, and pass the skel
etons of the dinosaurs again. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Youfour are going tohave a little company out in the  
  park. Spend a little time 
with our target audience.  
  Mayb e they'll help youget the spirit of this place. 

 
    GRANT 
  Whatdoeshe mean by "target audience"? 
 
 Hammond turns toward thedoor of thecenterand throwshis arms  
 out expansively. 
 
    HAMMOND

  KIDS!! 
 
 Twokids standing inthe doorway 
to the center break intoa broad  
 smil es.  TIM, the boy, is about ni

 looks around twelve. 
 
    TIM & LEX

 They race ac ross the lobby and in
to Hammond's arms,knocking him 
 over on thesteps. 
 
    LEX 
  We miss you. 
 
    TIM 
  Thanks for the presents. 
 

    LEX 
  We love the presents. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  You must be careful with me. Didyou like the

    TIM 
  It was great!  It dr

 Grant looks on. 
 
 
31 EXT VISITOR'S CENTER DAY 
 
 Two modified FordExplorers leap up out of an underground garage  
 beneath the visitor's

 Ellie is off to the sidewith ALEXIS,introducingherself  
 warmly. 
 
 HAMMOND is with MALCOLM, GRANT, and GENNARO. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a  
  divorce and they needthe diversion. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Hey!  Where are the brakes? 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Brakes?  No. No brakes.  They're electric cars,guided  
  by this tr ack in the roadway, and totally non-polluting,  

  top of the line!

    HAMMOND 
  Spared no expense. Have fu

  the control (or) back in control. 
   (to Ellie) 
  Come along, mydear. You'

  can promise y ou y ou'll hav e a real w onderful time. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Oh thank you so much.   So you'll see you later then.  
 
 Hammond turns and head back 
towards the Visitor's Center. 
 
    MALCOLM 
   (too eagerly; to Grant) 
  I'll ride with Dr. Sattler. 
   (or) 
  I'm going to ride withDr. Sattler. 
 

 He turns and walks over to E llie.  Grant fr owns, not liking this  
 one bit.  He moves tofollow, but TIM cutshim off, and stares up at  
 him, wide-eyed 
 
    TIM 
  I read your book. 
 
    GRANT 
  Oh, yeah - - great. 
 

 Grant heads for the rear car. Tim follows. 
 
    TIM 
  You really t hink dinosaurs turned int o birds?And  
  that'swhere all the dinosaurswent? 
 
 Grant opens the door of the rear car and climbs in. Tim 
 follow s . 
 

    GRANT 
  Well, uh, afew species- - mayhave evolved, uh--  
  along those lines - -yeah. 
 
 A mechanical voice intones fr om inside: 
 
    VOICE 
  "Two tofour passengers to acar, please.  Children  
  undertenmustbe accompanied by an adult." 

 
 Tim is right behind Grant, so
 Grant keeps moving, across the  
 back seat of thecar and out 
the other door.  But Tim follows. 
 
    TIM 
  Because they suredon't look like birds to me. I heard  
  a meteor hit the earthand made like this onehundred  
  mile crater someplac
e down in Mexico - - 
 

    GRANT 
  Listen, ahh - - 
 
    TIM 
  Tim. 
 
    GRANT 
  Tim.  Which car were you planning on- - 
 

    TIM 
  Whichever one you are. 
 
 Grant goesto the frontcar again, opens the rear door, and  
 holds it forTim, w ho cli mbs in theback  seat, rattling on and on. 
 
    TIM 

  Then I head about thisthing in OMNI?  Aboutthe meteor  
  making all this heatthat ma
de a bunch of diamond dust?  
  And that changed the weathe
r and they diedbecause of 
  theweather?  Then myteacher told me about this other  
  book by a guynamed Bakker?  And he said the dinosaurs 
  died of a bunch of diseas es. 
 
 SLAM!  Grant closes the car door on Tim. He turns and head for  
 the rear vehicle - - 
 

 - - andbumps right into Lex. 
 
    LEX 
   (points at Ellie) 
  She said I should ride with 
you because itwould be good  
  for you.

    GRANT 
  She's adeeply neurotic woman.

32 INTCONTROL ROOM DAY 
 

 The Jurassic Park control room 
looks like a mission control for  
 a space launch,with several comput
er terminals and dozens of video  
 screens that display images of variou
s dinosaurs, takenfrom all over  
 the park. 
 
 There's a large glass map of the is
land at the front of the room  
 that is lit up like a C hristmas tr ee with variouscolored lights, each  
 one with anumber and identification codenext to it. 
 

 But the place is unfinished,
 with unattachedcables,  
 construction materials, and ladders scatteredabout. 
 
 The mood among the half dozen T
ECHNICIANS present is chaotic as 
 they rush aroundwith 
last-minute adjustments. 
 
 MULD OONwh isks in  throu gh th edou ble doors.  HAMMOND  is righ t

 Hammond sighs and looks

    HAMMOND 
  Why didn'tI build in Orlando? 
 
    MULDOON 
  I'll keep an eye on it.Mayb e it'll swing south like

  Will you turn thatthing off? 
 
 Ellie flips aswitch and theywa

 IN THE PADDOCK, 
 
 there is a low HUMMING sound. Ou

 The cage bars slide down,  leavin

 alone in the middle of the field. 
 
 It's a goat,one leg chained to
 a stake.  It looks around,  
 confused, and BLEATSplaintively.

 Ellie. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  You see? The tyrannosaur doesn'tobey set patterns or  

  park schedules.  It'sthe essence ofChaos. 
 
    ELLIE 
  I'm still not clear on Chaos. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  It simply deals with unpredictability in complex  
  systems.  It's only princi

 Malcolm, lookin g fo r anoth er example - - 
 
    MALCOLM (cont'd) 
   (points to the glass ofwater) 
  Here.  Give me your glass ofwater. 
 

 He dips his hand into the glass of water.  He takes Ellie's hand  
 in his own. 
 
    MALCOLM (cont'd) 
  M ake like hieroglyphics.   N o

 He flicks his fingers and a dropfalls onthe back ofEllie's  
 hand. 

 
    MALCOLM (cont'd) 
  Ready?  Freeze yourhand. 
 Now I'm going todo thesame 
  thin gfrom th e exact same place.  Whichway is the drop  
  going to roll off? 
   (or) 
  Whichwaywill the drop roll?  Over which finger?  Or  
  down your thumb?  Or to the otherside? 
 

    ELLIE 
  Uh - - thumb! 
   (or) 
  The same way.

  And even ifwe haven'tseen it yet,I'm quite sure it's  
  going on inthis park  rightnow. 
 
 There's definitely  something out in that field,and Grant has to  

 see it. 
 
 He jerks onthe doorhandle and 
opens his door a few inches.  He  
 looks outside towardsfreedom, then
 looks around to is anybody's  
 watching him. 
 
 Malcolm lowers hisvoice, be

 so excited he canhardly k
eephis feet on the ground. 
 
    TIM 
  So like I was saying, there's this other book by a guy  
  named Bakker?  Andhe said 
dinosaurs died of a bunch of 
  diseases?  He de
finitely didn't say they turned into  
  birds. 

 
 Gennaro is scared as hell, following the others, buthis head  
 darting leftand right. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something? 
 

    GENNARO 
  Uh - - an ybody else thin kwe sh ouldn't be outhere?

    ELLIE 

  Yours was fully illustrated, honey. 
 
    GENNARO 
  Anybody atall.  Feel free to speakup. 
 
 Lex stumbles and Grant takesher ha

 She looks up athim and smiles. 
 
 Grant smiles back andtries to 
recover his hand, butLexholds  
 tight.  He's massively unc
omfortable. Ellie notices. 
 
 Suddenlythey all stop in their tracks. Ahugesmile spreads

 follow s . 
 
    ELLIE 
  Timmy, Timmy. 
 

    LEX 
  Come back he
re, blanket head. 
 
 Fearless, Tim walks forward behind Grant. 
 
    HARDING (O.S.) 
  Hi everybody, Don't be scared. 
 
 Tim reaches theclearing and sees: 

 
 A Triceratops, a big one, lying on its side, blocking the light  
 at th e end of th e path . It has an enormous curved shell that flanks  
 its head,two big hornsover its ey
es, and athird onthe end of its  
 nose.  It doesn't move, justbreath
es, loud and raspy, blowingup a  
 little clouds of dust 
with every exhalation. 
 
 Grant stands next to Harding, almost in a daze. 
 

    GRANT 
  Beautiful.  Is it okay? Can I touch it? 
 
    HARDING 
  Sure. 
 
 Grant walks next tothe animal and strokes itshead. Ellie  

 moves forward to the animal. 
 
    GRANT 
  Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's themost beautiful 
  thing I ever saw. 
 
    ELLIE 
  It's my favorite. 
 
 Theyboth kneel, checking the animal. 

 
 He furrowshis bow, noticing 
something, all professional  
 curiosity now. The animal's tongue, dark purple, droops limply from  
 its mouth. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Ellie, take a look at this. 
 
    ELLIE 

  Yeah, baby girl, it's okay. 
 
 She scratches thetongue with herfingernail.  A clear liquid  
 leaks fr om the broken blisters. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Micro vesicles.  That's interesting. 
 
 Grant, fascinated, wanders all the 
way around to the back of the  
 animal.  Harding joins Ellie and handsher hispenlight. 
 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
  What are her symptoms ? 
 
    HARDING 
  Imbalance, disorientation, la
bored breathing.  Seems to  
  happen about every six weeks or so. 
 

    ELLIE 
  Six weeks? 
 
 She takes the penlightfrom theveterinarian and shines it in  
 the animal's eyes. 
 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
  Are there pupillary ef f ects f rom the tranquilizer? 
 

    HARDING 
  Yes, mitotic, pupils 
should be constricted. 
 
    ELLIE 
  These are dilated.  Take a look. 
 
    HARDING 

  They are? 
   (checks it out) 
  I'll be damned. 
 
    ELLIE 
  That's pharmacological .  From local plant life. 
 
 She turns and studies the surrounding landscape.  Her mind's  
 really at work, pu zzlin g ov
er eachpiece of foliage. 
 

    ELLIE (cont'd) 
   (pointing) 
  Is that (or)this West Indian lilac? 
 
    HARDING 
  Y es.  We know they're toxic,  but the animals don't eat 
  them. 
 
    ELLIE 

  Are you sure? 
 
    HARDING 
  Pretty sure. 
 
    ELLIE 
  There's only onewayto be positive.  Ineed tosee some 
  droppings. 
   (or) 

  I haveto see the dinosaur's droppings. 
 
    HARDING 
  Youwon't be able to miss them. 
   (or) 
  Can't miss them. 
 
 Malcolm walks up to Ellie. 
 

    MALCOLM 
  Dino droppings? 
 
    ELLIE 
  Yeah. 
 
 She walksway, Malcolm looks on. 
 
 

41A INT CONTROL ROOM DAY 
 
 HAMMONDand ARNOLD arewatching thevideo monitors,displeased  
 about something.  Arnold is looking at one that gives them a viewfrom  
 the beach, looking out 
at the ocean. The clouds beyond are almost  
 black with a tropical storm. 
 

    ARNOLD 
  That storm center hasn't 
dissipated or changed course. 
  We're going tohave tocutthetour short, I'mafraid.   
  Pick it  up again tomorrow where we left off. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  You're surewe have to? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  It's not worth taking the chance, John. 

 
    MULDOON

    HAMMOND

  Tell them whenthey get back tothe cars. 
 

    MULDOON 
   (into phone) 
  Thanks, Steve. 
 
    ARNOLD 
   (making anannouncement to the others) 
  Ladies and gentlemen, last sh

  approximately five minutes.  
Dropwhat you are doing and  
  leave now. 

 
    HAMMOND 
  Damn! 
 
 
41 ACROSS THE ROOM 
 
 NEDRY stares at hisvideo monitor, watchingthe boat.  He's on  
 the phonewith theMATE, 
whose images he can see on the monitor.  The  
 seas around thedock are much rougher now. 
 
    MATE 
  We're notwell-berthed here without a storm barrier!  We  
  may have to leave as soon 
as the last oftheworks are  
  aboard. 
 
    NEDRY 
   (low voice) 

  No, no. You stick tothe plan. You wait till they're  
  back from the tour. 
 
 
 
42 EXT FIELD DAY 
 

 As the weather grows darker, ELLI
E, GRANT, HARDING, and MALCOL M  
 are grouped around anenormous spoor 
of triceratops excreta that stands  
 at least waist high andis covered with BUZZING f lies. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  That is onebig pile of shit. 
 
 Ellie has plastic gloves on the 
reach up to herelbows, and is  
 just withdrawing her hand 
from the middle of the dung. 
 

    ELLIE 
   (to Harding) 
  You're right.  There'sno trace of lilac berries.   
  That's so weird, though. 
 Sheshows all the classic  
  signs of Meliatoxicity, 
   (thinking aloud) 
  Everysix weeks - - 
 
 She turns andwalks out into 
the op en field a few paces,  
 thinking. Malcolm watches her, and looks back  atthedung. 
 
    MALCOLM 
   to Grant) 
  She's, uh -- tenacious. 
 
    GRANT 
  You have no idea. 
 

    MALCOLM 
   to Ellie) 
  Youwill remember to wash yourhands before you eat  
  anything? 
 
 
43 INTCONTROL ROOM DAY 
  
 DENNISNEDRY is busily and surrept it iously t yping a series of  

 commands intohis console.  On hi
sscreen, a cartoon handwindsup a 
 cartoon clock, moving its second ha
ndupto the twelve. The clock  
 rotates around tofaceus. 
 
 It has a large green dollar sign
 in the middle.  A big word 
 appears onscreen, anoption surro
unded byforbidding red box.   
 "EXECUTE," it says. 
 
 

44 EXT PARK DAY 
  
 The skies are really foreboding
 now, and there's a sense of  
 growing urgency. ELLIE is by the 
animal, a short distance awayfrom  
 the group.GRANT is near her, thinking. 
 
    GRANT 

 Ellie, I've been thinking 
there's something about the  
 periodicit y doesn'thad up. 
 
    ELLIE 
  I know. 
 
 Tim holds one ofthe smooth rock
s up and calls out, a little  
 timidly. 
 
    TIM 

  These look kind of familiar. 
 
    GRANT 
  Triceratops was aconstant browser, and constant  
  browsers would be constantly sick. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Constantly sick. 
 

    GRANT 
  Not just every six weeks. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Yeah, I know. 
 
    TIM 
  I've seen pictures of these! 
 

 Grant tu rnsand looks at him, a little annoyed. 
 
    TIM 
  In your fully illustratedbook. 
 
 Grant just rolls his eyes, butE
llie comes over and checksout  
 the stones. 
 
    ELLIE 

  What's that? 
 
 A light goes on inher ey es. 
 
    ELLIE  
  Alan - - gizzard stones! 
 
 She throwsGrant one of  the stones
.  They look at each other in  
 amazement. 

 
 As before,when theyget excite
d, they talk right over each  
 other. 
 
    GRANT 
  Elm that's it,  it explains theperiodicity,  the - - 
 

    ELLIE 
  - -theundigested state of
 the berries because it's -- 
 
    GRANT 
  - - totally incidental 
   (or) 
  unrelated to thefeeding pattern -- 
 
    TIM 
  What areyou guys saying? 

 
    ELLIE 
   (turning to Tim) 
  It's simple, see.  Someanimals like her, don'thave  
  teeth - - 
 
    GRANT 
  - - lik e birds -- 
 

    ELLIE 
  - - like birds. What happen is,they swallow the stones  
  andhold them in a muscular sackin their stomachs - - 
 
    GRANT 
  - - a gizzard -- 
 
    ELLIE 
  - -which iscalled a gizzard, and ithelps themmash 

  their food,butwhathappens aftera while - - 
 
    GRANT 
  - -whathappens is that af
ter a while, the stones get   
  smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them  
  - - 
 
    ELLIE 
   (for Tim) 

  - - barfs them up - - 
 
    GRANT 
  - - andswallows fresh ones. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Andwhen she swallows th
estones, she sw
allows t he  
  poison berries too. That'swhat makes her sick. 
   (impressed) 

  Good work Tim. 
 
 She looks at Grant pointedly. 
 Tim looks up atGrant too,  
 smiling from ear to ear.  Grant 
GRUNTS, not so easily convinced. 
 
 THUNDER rumbles as the storm overhe
ad is aboutto bust loose.   
 GENNARO,scared of more than one 
thingnow, putshis foot down. 

 
    GENNARO 
  Doctors, if you please - 
- Ihave to insist we get  
  moving. 
 
    ELLIE 
 Oh,youknow, if it's alright, I'd like to staywithDr.  
 Harding and finishwiththe trike. Is that okay? 
 
    HARDING 

  Sure.  I'vegot a gas powere
d jeep.  I can drop her at  
  the visitor's center before I make the boatwith the  
  others. 
 
    ELLIE 
   (to Grant) 
  I'll catch up with you. You can gowith the others. 
 
    GRANT 

  Are you sure? 
 
    ELLIE 
  I'll just finish. Yeah, Iwant tofinish. 
 
 There is a lightning flash now, with a tooth-rattling  
 THUNDERCLAP right on its heels. 
 
    GENNARO 

  Now. 
 
 Grant turnsand followsthe others,Lex right inhis tracks.  
 Ellie and Harding go back to the tric
eratops,which is starting to come  
 back to life.  
 
 As Grant reaches theExplorer, he
turns back for one last look  
 at Ellie.  He raises h is han d to wave, but sh e is tu rn ed the oth er way.   
 Feeling silly, hedropshis hand and 
goes into the woods. Just ashe  
 does, Ellie t urns and waves t ohim, but wit hhis back t urned, he misses  
 it too. 
 
 In this way, they say goodbye. 
 
 BACK AT THECARS,

 HAMMOND is with RAYARNOLD, 
staring at the video screens. 
 
    ARNOLD 
  I found away to re-route through the program.  I'm  
  turning the cars around
 in the restarea loop. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren onthe  
  radio will you?  I don'twant them to worry about a wee  
  bit of rain. 

 
 Arnold reaches forthehand microphone. 
 
 ACROSS THE ROOM, 
 
 DENNISNEDRY, sweatforming onhis upper lip now, is staring at  
 his video monitor.  The supplyboat is still docked onthe island   
 shore, bu t is now being buffeted by
 heavy waves.   N edrywhispers  
 sharply into thephone, arguing with 
the MATEof the shipagain, whohe  
 can see onthe video monitor. 
 
    MATE 
  There'snothing I can do!  If the Captain sayswe gotta  
  go, we gotta go! 
 
    NEDRY 
  No, no, listen to me. You've 
got to give me this time.   
  I did a testrun on  thisth

  minutes. Ithought I could do it in fifteen- - you've  
  got to giveme fifteenminutes. 
 
    MATE 
  No promises! No promises! 
 
    NEDRY 
  I'll be there in ten!  
 

 Arnold SNAPS a button onhis console. 
 
    ARNOLD 
  Visitor vehicles are on their wayback tothegarage. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  So how muchfor ourfirst tour. Tw o no-shows and one  

  sick triceratops. 
 
    ARNOLD 
  It couldhave been worse, John . Itcould havebeen a  
  lot worse. 
 
 Dennis Nedry stands up. 
 
 He' s sh aking in  h is sh oes, but tryin g like h ell to  be casu al. 
 

    NEDRY 
  Anybodywant a Coke? Anybodywhat somefrom the  
  machines? Or a soda or something?  Ihadtoo many  
  sweets. 
   (or) 
  I thought I'd get something sweet. 
 
 Hammond and Arnold shake their he
ads.  Nedry starts to leave,  
 then turnsbackwith an afterthought
that is so rehearsed its almost  
 obvious. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  Oh, I finished de-bugging 
the phones, but thesystem's  
  compiling for eighteen mi

  minor systems may goon an

  nothing toworry about.  Simple thing.... 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Okay, okay, okay, okay
, that's enough! Ahh! 
 
 Nedry turns, stretchesone finger
 outto his screen, and selects  
 an option. 
 
 "EXECUTE." 
 
 At the same time, he presses 
thestart button on his digital  
 stopwatchhe holds in his hand.  Adigital clock on the computer screen  

 startsto tick  downfrom sixty seco

 sound too -- something like the "Jeopardy"theme. 
 
 He starts to leave - - but returnswhen he remembers the shaving  
 cream can. He grabs it and leaves. 
 
 
48 EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT 
 

 Nightwas completely fallen now, and the rainhas started.  It's  
 a tr opical storm, the rain falling in drenchingsheets on the roofs and 
 hoods of the Explorers, which arema
king their way slowly back tothe  
 visitor's center. 
 
 IN THE REAR CAR, 
 

 GRANT andMALCOLM are alone.  Gr

 IN THE COOLER, 
 
 Nedry hurries in and flips openthe hatch on the bottom of the  
 shavingcream can, revealing slotted 
compartments inside. He goes to 
 the rack ofdozens of thin glass s
lides.  A sign says"VIABLEEMBRYOS -

 He takes the slides out of the ra

 The cars jerk to a stop. The lig

 the road go out, plunging them into
 blackness.  Grant jerks hishands  
 awayfrom the steering 
column, immediately assu

    GRANT 
  What'd I touch?! 
 
    MALCOLM 

  You haven't touched

 Muldoon heads for the door just as
 all th e video mon ito rs in  th e

 The three of them freeze for a mo

 The tension in the room goes upa notch. 
 
    HAMMOND 
   (t o Arnold) 
  Use Nedry's terminal.  Get it all back on. He can de- 
  bug later. 
 
 ARNOLD pushes off onthe floor and whizzes over to Nedry's  
 master terminal in his chair. With
 onestroke of his arm, hebrushes  
 all the loose junk off Nedry's statio

 magazine pages - - and tries towork. 
 
    ARNOLD 
  God, look at  this workst at ion.

56 EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT 
 
 A wire mesh fence in front of us has a very clear sign: 
 
 DANGER! ELECTRIFIED FENCE! 
 This DoorCannot Be Opened

 A hand reaches out, grabs the fence by the bare wire, flips a  
 latch, and shoves the door
 open. No sparks fly. 
 
 DENNIS NEDRY runs from the fence 
back to his jeep, drops it in  
 gear, andtears off down the park road
. Therain is absolutely flowing  

 down now,the road israpidly turning to mud. 
 
 IN THE JEEP, 
  
 Nedry can barely see throughthewindshield.  He's driving as  
 fast as possible, checking 
his watch everyfew seconds. 
  
 He leans forw ard,squinting to seethrough the w indshield,  
 wiping offthe condensation withhis free hand.  A fork in the road  
 rushes intoview.  He jumps on 
thebrakes -- to late.  Thejeep  
 careens into a signpost. 
 
    NEDRY 
  Shit! 
 
 He throws the door open and hurries to the fallen sign: "To The  
 Docks" . He props itup- the directional arrow swingshopelessly on a  
 nail.  He clenches his jaws and growls. 
 

 Soaked, Nedry stompsback to hiscar. 
 
 Although he doesn't look too conv

 As Tim watches,the door of the

He moves into the back seatwith  
 Lex who is tapping herhat, and

 BOOM.  BOOM. BOOM. 
 
    TIM 

  Did you feel that?

  Can you feel that? 
 
 She don't answer. 
 
 Tim leans over to the front pass

 As hewatches, the water in the gl

  What isthat?  M-Maybe it's th e power trying to come  
  back on. 
 
 Tim jumps into the back seat andputs the goggles on again. 

 
    LEX 
  What is that? 
 
    GENNARO 
  What is what? 
 
 Tim turns and looks out the side 
window. Hecan see the area  
 where the goat is tethered.  Orwas tethered. T he chain is still  
 there, butthe goat is gone. 

 
 BANG! 
  
 They all jump, and Lex SCREAMS as
 somethinghits thePlexiglas  
 sunroof ofthe Explorer, hard.  They look up. 
 
 It's a bloody, disembodied goat leg. 
 
    GENNARO 

  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus. 
  
 Tim whips aroundto look out the side windowagain.  Hismouth  
 pops open,butno sound comes out. 
 Throughthe goggles, hesees an  
 animal claw, ahuge one, gripping 
the cables of the "electrified"  
 fence. 
 
 Tim whips the gogglesoff and 
presses forward, againstthe  
 window.  He looks up,up,than cranes hishead back further, to look 

 out the sunroof. Pastthe goat's leg, he can see - - 
 
 - -Tyrannosaurus rex. It stands maybe tw enty-fiv e feethigh,  
 fortyfeet longfrom nose to tail, with an enormous, boxlike head that 
 mustbe five feet longby itself. The remains of the goathang out of 
 the rex's mouth.  It tilts its headback and swallows the animal in one  
 big gulp. 
 
 Gennaro can't even speak.  His hand claws for thedoor handle,  

 he shoulders it open, and takes off, out of thecar. 
 
    LEX 
   (freaking out) 
  He left us! He left us alone! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!   
  He left us! He left us! 
 
 
62 ON THE ROAD, 

 
 Gennaro runs away, as fast ashe 
can, right past the second car,  
 towards a cement block outhouse
 twenty or thirty yards away. 
 
 He reaches it, ducks inside, and pulls the doorafter him -- 
 
 - -but there's no latch, just a round hole in the unfinished  

 door.  Gennaro backs into a stall, frantic. 
 
 Thewhole bathroom begins to shake. 
 
63 IN THE REAR CAR,  
 
 Grant andMalcolm turn in the direction Gennaro went. 
  
    GRANT 
  Where does he think he's going? 

  
    MALCOLM 
  Whenyou gotta go, you gottago. 
 
 Malcolm looks the other way, out 
the passenger window. As he  
 watches,the fence begins to bu
ckle, its post collapsing into  
 themselves, the wi
res SNAPPING free. 
 
    MALCOLM 

  Whatwasthat all about? - - 
 
 Grant nowturns and watches as, 
ahead ofthem, the "DANGER!"  
 sign SMACKS down on the hood of the firstExplorer.  The entire fence 
 is coming down, the posts collaps
ing, the cables SNAPPING as - - 
 
 - -theT-rex chews itswaythrough th e barrier. 
 
 Theywatchin horror as theT-re
xsteps over the ruined barrier  
 and intothe middle of the park ro
ad.  It just standsthere for a  
 moment, swinging itshead from one vehicle to the other. 
 
64 IN THE FRON TCAR, 
 
 The rexstrides aroundto the si
de of the car and peers down,  
 from high above. Tim leaps into the front seat andpulls the driver's 
 door shut.  Both kids
 are terrified, breathing 
hard, unable to speak. 
 

    TIM 
  Please!  Please! 
 
65 IN THE REAR CAR,  
 
    MALCOLM 
  Boy, do Ihate being right all thetime. 
 
    GRANT 

  Look at that! 
 
 The T-rex turns and strides quickly backtowards them.  It  
 circles, slowly, bendingover to l
ook in at them through the window. 
 
 Grant andMalcolm sit tremblin g in  thefront seat, watching as  
 the giant legs stride
 past their windows. 

 
    GRANT 
  (a quiv ery whisper) 
  Keep absolutely still - -it's vision'sbased on  
  movement! 
 
    MALCOLM 
  You're sure?! 
 
    GRANT 

   (pause) 
  Relatively. 
 
 Malcolm freezes as therex bends 
down andpeers right inthrough  
 his window.  The dinosaur's giant,yellowing eye is only slightly  
 smaller than the en
tire pane of glass 
 
 The T-rex pulls away slight ly,t henreaches down and BUMPS t he  
 car with itssnout, rocking it. 

 
66 IN THE FRON TCAR, 
 
 Lex is rummaging around in the back cargo area, looking for  
 something,anything. She finds a flashlight. 
 
67 ON THE ROAD, 
 
 The frontcar lights up from withinas Lex switches on the 

 flashlight. 
 
 The dinosaur raises its head. It
 turns slowly from the second  
 car to the first car, drawn byth
e light. Making a decision, it  
 strides over to the 
firstvehicle.  FAST. 
 
68 IN THE FRON TCAR, 
 
 Tim and Lex can only stare out 
of the windows as the T-rex  
 reaches their car and starts to circle it. 
 
 The rexbends down and looks in through thefrontwindshield,  
 then the side window. Tim is eye 
to eye with the thing for a second, 
 then the dinosaur raises its headup, abovethecar. 
 
    LEX 
  I'm sorry -- I'm sorry- - 
 

    TIM 
  Tu rn it off,Lex! Tu rn  it off! 
 
 Tim climbs over the seat and joins Lex. 
 
    TIM (cont'd) 
  Where is the buttonthen? 

 
    LEX 
  I don't know, I don'tknow.  I'm sorry - - 
 
    TIM 
  Why did you dothis? 
 
    LEX 
  I don't know! I'm sorry! 
 

 The Kids look up, through the sunroof, asthe head goeshigher,  
 and higher, and higher, and then the 
rex turns, looks straightdown at  
 them through the sunroof, opens its mouthwide and- - 
 
 - - ROARS. 
 
 Thewindows RATTLE, Lex SCREAMS, the flashlight goes on again,  
 and the tyrannosaur strikes. 
 

 SMASH! The thing's head its the plastic sunroof,knockingthe  
 whole frame right outof 
the roofof the car and do
wn into thevehicle.   
 The bu bble falls down on to Tim and Le
x, trapping them, and the animal  
 lunges down,through the hole, SNAPPING at them. 
 
 The Plex iglas holds,though and pr
otects Tim and Lex even as it  
 pins themto the seats.  The T-re
xcontinues to push down, andthe 
 glass GROANS, crack lines racing across it. 
 

 Tim, whosefeet were caught above him, pushes back, only  an inch  
 of glass betweenhim an
d the dinosaur'steeth. 
 
69 IN THE REAR CAR,  
 
 Grant andMalcolm watch in horror 
as the dinosaur claws at the  
 side of thevehicle with on
e of it s powerful thigh legs. 
 
 It push es, starting totip the car over. 

 
    MALCOLM 
  Oh my God! 
 
    GRANT 
  We gotta do something. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  What? What can wedo? 

 
    GRANT 
  There's gotta be something - - 
 
 Grant looksaround, climbs over 
the seat.  Hetears apartthe  
 back area,searching -and finally 
finds a metal case.  Heopens it,  
 finding flares.  He grabs one and mo
ves quickly back tothe driver's  

 seat and opens the door. 
 
 Malcolm grabs a flare, too. 
 
70 IN THE FRON TCAR, 
 
 the glasswindows SHATTE R, theKi
ds are thrown to the side, and  
 the Explorer tilts. 
 
 The rexbends down and nudgesthe 
car with its head, rolling it  
 up on its side.  Tim and Lextumble around. 
 
71 ON THE ROAD 
 
 the T-rex starts tonudge theExplorer toward thebarrier.  Over  
 the barrier, there is a gentle terraced area at one side where the rex  
 emerged from, but the car isn't next to that, it's nextto asharp  
 precipice, representing a fifty or sixtyfoot drop. 
 

 The car, upside downnow,
 is pushed near the edge. 
 
 The rextowers over the car. Like a dog, its puts onefoot on  
 the chassisand tears atheundercarriage with its jaws. 
 
 Biting at anything it can get a hold of, it ripsthe rear axle  
 free, tosses it aside, and bites intoa tire. 
 
 The tire EXPLODES, startling theanimal. 

 
72 INSIDE THE CAR, 
 
 Tim and Lex are trapped inside th
e rapidly flattening car.  As  
 the frame continuestobuckle, they  crawl toward the open rear window,  
 the carcollapsing behind them. Mu
d and rainwater pout intowhat   
 litt le space there is left. 
 
 Tim is ahead, nearingthe back 
window,whenthere is a CRUNCH  
 and a seatcomes down, pinninghim. 
 
73 ON THE ROAD, 
 
 the dinosaur backsup,dragging 
the Explorer,swin gin g it left  
 and right.  It seems ready to fling it over the edge. 
 
 Grant getsout of his car.  He'sholding the flare in one hand,  
 which he pulls the top off of. Bright flames shoot out the end of it. 

 
    GRANT 
  Hey!  Hey! Over here! 
 
 The T-rex turns 
and looks athim 
  
 Grant waves the flare slowly in front of him from side to side.   

 The T-rex follows hismoving arm, ey
es locked ontheflare.  Grant  
 looks over to thewall,  and tosses
 the flare over the edgeof the  
 barrier.  The rex lunges after it- - 
 
 Unclear with Grant's plan,Malcolm leaps out of the car and  
 tries to scare uptheT-rex's attention with hisownnewly lit flare.   
 He begins to wave it at the animal.  Grant sees him -- 
 
    GRANT 
  Ian! Freeze!  Freeze! Get rid of the flare! 

 
    MALCCOLM 
  Get the kids! 
 
 Malcolm inches back slowly, thentakes off, runningforhis life  
 down the road.  He runs to the ceme
nt blockouthouse Gennaro went into  
 earlier. 
 
 The T-rex sees the movement. 
Itwhirls and takes of f af ter  
 Malcolm, fast. 
 
 Malcolm runs as fast ashe can, approaching the outside just  
 steps ahead of the T-rex 
 
 But not far enough ahead.  With
out evenslowing down, the rex  
 leans forward andflicks Malcolm into the airwith its snout. 
 
 It's just anudge afor the rex,butit sendsMalcolm sailing  

 right through awooden portion of
the wall, and into the building. 
 
 
74 IN THE RESTROOM 
 
 Gennaro,who cowers in a corner, 
SCREAMS as teh headof the T- 
 rex EXPLODES throughthe front ofthe building, sending chunks of  
 cement fly ing in all directions  inside.  The roof collapses;  Gennaro  
 tr ies to protect himself fr om thefalling junk. 

 
 
75 ON THE ROAD 
 
 Grant getson hisfeetandwatches as th e T-rex noses around in  
 the rubble. 
 
 It seems tofind something.  It lunges, and Grant canhear 
 Gennaro SCREAMING, the sound piercing - - 

 
 - -until it abruptly stops. 
 
 Grant scrambles over to the car. 
 
    GRANT 
  Tim!  Lex! 

 
    LEX 
  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant! 
 
 He lays on the ground, looking inside, and seesL ex st aringup  
 at him, conscious, he
rface covered in mud. 
 
    GRANT 
  Are you okay? Can you move? 
   (calling in to the car) 

  Tim!  Are you okay?

  Let's get you out. 
 
 - --- - -- - - - - -- - -- --- - -- - - - - -- - - 
 
 Grant reaches in and drags her out. 
  
    GRANT 

  Are you okay?  Good girl. 
 
 Grant tries to find Tim 
  
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Tim?  Tim? 
 
 Lex, staring over his shoulder, SCREAMS.  Grantwhirls, covering  
 her mouthat the same time. 

 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Shhh! Don't move! Itcan't see us if we don'tmove. 
 
 Lex looks at him like he's cr
azy,but freezes.  Theywait. 
 
 BOOM!  A big T-rex foot print smacks down in front of them as  

 the dinosaurs approaches the car ag
ain.  It leans do
wn, rightpast  
 them, and SNIFFS the car, ragged bi
ts of flesh andclothing hanging  
 from its teeth. 
 
 Not findinganything,the dinosaur swings itshead away,  
 SNORTING loudly through it snose.  Grant'shat flies offhis head.  
 Stil l, he doesn't mov e. 
 
 The rexwalks to the back of the car.  It bendsdown. 
 

 WHAP! The car spins as it is pushed from behind by the rex.   
 Grant and Lex  are pushed in frontof it,helpless. They scramble  
 around on their knees,trying to ke
ep ahead of thecar,which the rex 
 is now pushing even closer 
to the edge of the barrier. 
 
 Grant and Lex crawl quickly, butthe car is moving faster, 
 catching up on them. 
 
 

76 INSIDE THE CAR 
 
 Tim awakens and SCRE
AMS. He tries to untangle himself. 
 
 
77 ON THE ROAD, 
 
 the T-rex looms over Lex and Gran
t, who aretrapped between the  
 car andthesixty foot drop. 

 
 
78 INSIDE THE CAR, 
 
 the rexbends down and sees Tim. 
 Tim backsaway, furiously, but  
 there's almost no room to move in 
there. Therex opens its mouthwide 
 and st retches it s tongue into the car. 
 
 Tim screams and kicksas thetongue
 tries towrap around him.   
 But it fails,andwithdrawsfrom the car. 
 
 
79 ON THE ROAD, 
 
 the T-rex still tries to get to Grantand Lex, pushing the car,  
 spinning on it s roof. Grant and Le
x scramble, tryingto avoid being  
 caught by the T-rex and crushed by the car. 
 

    GRANT 
  This way! 
 
 The back of thecar almost crus
hesthem against the barrier - - 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Get back! 

 
 They move, as the rexcontinues to move thecar towards the  
 edge.  Grant finally gets onthewall, Lex follows. 
 
 The T-rex ROARS in frustration.  Itbends down for onefinal  
 lunge atthe car. 
 
 Grant sees it coming.He grabs 
one of the dangling fencecables  
 on the other side of the barrier. 
 

    GRANT 
  Grab a hold of me! 
 
 She wrapsher arm around hisneck. 
 He scrambles to the edge of  
 the barrier, and startsto climb down. 
 
    LEX 
   (screaming) 
  Timmy!  Timmy! 

 
 The cable is slick  w ith rain, and it's all Grant can doto hang  
 on ashe and Lex slide rapidly down
.  Abov e them, thevehicle is now 
 teetering over the edge, 
threatening to drop right ontopof them if  
 they didn't hurry. 
 
 Grant GASPS, asLexhas un wittingly startedto choke him as she  
 holds onfor dear life.  
 

    GRANT 
  You're choking me! 
 
 The car GROANS,nearly over the 
edge now. Grant looksto the  
 side.  There are other cables, out 
of the line ofthe car's impending  
 drop.  His feet scrambling along the concretewall,  Granttries to  
 swing overtowards one. 
 
    GRANT 

  Grab a wire! 
 
 Buthe falls short.  Hismoment
um carries them back the other  
 way, but on thesecond swing Lexma
nages to grab hold of the second  
 cable. 
 
    LEX 
  I got it! 
  

 The carfalls.  Lex andGrant are clear by inches, clinging to  
 the second cable. 
 
    LEX 
  Timmy! 
 
 The carCRUNCHES into the leafytop of atree, resting onits  

 roof some fifteenfeet below them. 
 
 The T-rex stares downat them, 
but they are safely out ofits  
 reach. 
 
 It ROARS once more, in afinal fit of frustration,turns - - 
 
 
A80 INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT 
 

 JOHN HAMMOND is lived 
 
    HAMMOND 
  I will kill Nedry. I will kill him. 
 
 Muldoon bursts through the door. 
 
    HAMMOND 
   (to Muldoon) 

  Well? 
 
    MULDOON 
  There'sno sign ofhim anywhere. 
 
 The game show music is louder and fasternow,very annoying. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Ray will you please switch off  

   (or) 
  stop that music?! 
 
 RAY ARNOLD'scigarette is practically burninghis lips, down to  
 almost nothin g in  his mouth.  Hehovers overNEDRY's computer termin al,  
 which is amass of  incomprehensible command sthat scroll by quickly as  
 he futilely  ex amines
 each one ofthem. 
 
 MULDOON paces.  ELLIE stares
 atArnold in amazement. 
 
    ELLIE 
 Are we getting anywhere with 
these procedures ofyours?  
 I mean,what'shanging us up? 
 
    ARNOLD 
 I ran akeycheck on every strokeNedry entered today.   
 It's all pretty standardstuff, until this one - - 
 

    ELLIE 
   (stands, joins the group atthe computer) 
  What one? 
 
 He points to his computer scr
een, to a specific series of  
 commands.  The others crowed over his shoulder and stare at the screen. 
 

    ARNOLD (cont'd) 
  "Keycheck /space -o keyche
ck off safety -o." He's  
  turning thesafety systems off.  Hedoesn'twant  
  anybody tosee what he's about todo. Now look atthis  
  next entry,it 's thekicker.  "Wht.rbt .obj."  What ever  
  it did, it did it all.   ButwithKeycheck off,the  
  computer didn't file thekeystrokes.  Onlyway to find  
  them now is to searchthe 
computer's lines of code one  
  by one. 
 

    ELLIE 
  How many lines of code are there? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  Uh - - about  two million. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Tw o mill ion -  - great. Thatw ouldhelp.

  Oh good, that'll take no time. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Robert -- Iwonder if perhaps youwould be kind

  grandchildren. 
 
    MULDOON 

  Sure. 
 
    ELLIE 
  I'm going with him. 
 
 Theyhead for the door.  Hammond turns, staring outthewindows  
 at the frontof the control room.  
He's gone pale, and he'ssweating,  
 wrappedup in million thoughts.  Behind him,Ray Arnold's voice calls  
 to him, buthe doesn'thear it. 

 
    ARNOLD 
  John -- John  - - 
 
 Hammond leans on hiscane, an dfo
r thefirst time he looks like  
 he's actually using it. 
 
    ARNOLD (cont'd) 
  John. 

 
 Hammond tu rns, finally hearin g him. 
 
    ARNOLD (cont'd) 
  I can't getJu rassic Park

80 EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT 
 
 As the raincontinues to pour down, a gas-powered jeep ROARS  
 down another park road. 
 
 
81 INTJEEP NIGHT 
 
 DENNISNEDRY drivesthe jeep asfast as hecan in the  

 treacherous conditions.  He MUTTERS tohimself, shakinghis head. 
  
    NEDRY 
  Shoulda been there by no
w - - shoulda been there - - 
 
 He hauls it around a corner and looks down, checking hiswatch.  
 Whenhe looks back 
up, his eyes go wide. 
 
 There's awhite wood guard rail fence, right in front ofhim.   

 He stands on the brakes ashard 
as he can. The 
jeep fishtails,  
 skidding out ofcontrolin  the mu dtowardsthe fence. 
  
 Nedry hauls thewheel hard totheside to tryto control the  
 skid, butthe jeep skids offthe road
, goinghalfway over the muddied  
 embankment. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  God damn it! 

 
 He drops the car in reverse and 
hits the gas. Thewheels spin,  
 sending mud flying everyw
here,but the jeep goes nowhere, just digsin  
 further. 
 
 Nedry can'tbelieve it.  Frustrated,he gets outof the jeep.   
 He stops suddenly -hecan see anot
her park road, downthe sloping  
 embankment, about tw
enty feetbelow. 
 

 There is a large sign alongside the road. Nedry leans forward  
 excitedly to get abetter look.  It reads "TO EAST DOCK." He scrambles  
 to the frontof the jeep. 
  
 ON THE HILLSIDE 
  
 NedryCRANKS a winch its coil on thefront end of the jeep. 
 
    NEDRY 

   (mumbling to himself) 
  No problem.  Winchthis sucker off thething -- tie it  
  do a thing - - pull it  down t he t hing -- and pull it   
  back up. 
 
 He loses his balance and slips - fa lling back onhis rear.  He  
 slides down the muddyembankment, ac
rossthe road below. Pissed, he  

 gets tohisknees and se
arches forhis glasses. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  Where are my glasses?  I can afford new ones. 
 
 He stands and grabs the winch, 
and goes to asturdy-looking tree  
 on the other side. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  You can make it! 

 
 From the distance, there is a soft HOOTING sound. There's some  
 movement in the bushes -Nedry looks 
aroundfor the source of th e sound  
 and movement. He doesn'tfind it.  He nervously checks his watch and  
 goes backto thewinch, butfaster. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  No problem - - popthis thing rightdown -- 
 

 The HOOTING comes again andNe
dry turns -again, nothing. 
 
 A figure ducks aroundthe tree an
d pops out on the otherside,  
 HOOTING playfully. 
 
 Nedry looks around one side of th
etree - nothing. Itpops up  
 on the other side, HOOTING again.  An
d Nedry looks again. Not hing. It   
 seems like a fr iendly game of hide-a
nd-seek. But Nedry begins to get  
 rattled. 

 
    NEDRY 
 That's nice. Gotta go. I'm getting out of here. C'mon  
 you can make it! 
 
 He securesthewinch and st arts across the road, backup the  
 embankment.  He freezes, as hefeel
s something behindhim.  He turns  
 around slowly and sees: 
 

 A dilophosaur. It stands only  about four feethigh, its spotted  
 like an owl, andhas abrilliant colo
red crest that flanks itshead.  
 It doesn't look verydangerous. Infact, it's kind of cute. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  Oh. Uh --nice boy. Nice boy.  Okay. Run along. I  
  don't haveanything for you! 
 Go on ! Go home! Dinner  
  time!  Are you hu ngry? They'll feed you!  Go, boy.   
  Girl.  Whatever. 

 
 The dilophosaur just stares at Nedry, tilting its head  
 curiously. Nedry looks 
around onthe groundand finds astick.  He  
 picks it  up and chucks it at the thing.  Hethrows it  as faras he can. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  Nice juicy stick!  Fetch! 

 
 The dilophosaur gets in to the spirit of th e game, but not th e  
 object. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  Lame brain!  What's the matter with you? 
   (or) 
  What's th ematter with you? 
 
 He shakeshis head and starts 
back towards the jeep, muttering  
 to himself. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
 Walnut brain...extinct kangaroo...hope I run over you on 
 theway down --  
 
 - --- - -- - - - - -- - -??-OR-??- - - - - -- - -- --- - - 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 

  Walnut brain...extinct kangaroo...hope I run over you on 
  the way down - - 
 
 He's near the top whenthe dilo
phosaur suddenly hops out right  
 in front him,  startlinghim.   N edry loses his balance and falls back,   
 right onhisrear.  He gets tohis feet, angry. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  I said - - 

 
 He picks up a stick and chucks it at thething. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  - - beat it! 
 
 - --- - -- - - - - -- - -- --- - -- - - - - -- - - 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 

  What areyou do- - 
 
 T he animals HISSES.  The brightlycolored fanaround itsneck  
 flares wildly, two bu lbous sacs oneither side of its neck in flate.  It  
 rears its head back again - - 
 
 - - and itSPITS. 
 
 SPLAT!  A big glob of something wet SMACKSinto the middle of  

 Nedry's chest. He reaches down an
d touchesthe goothat's dribbling  
 down his slicker. 
 
    NEDRY (cont'd) 
  That's disgusting! 
  
 SPLAT!  Another glob of goo SM
ACKS intothehighlight, right  

 next to Nedry's head. 
 
 He stands up.  A look of confus
ion crosses his face.  He lifts  
 his right hand,the onethat hetouched the spit with, and looks at it  
 strangely, flexing it. 
 
 POW! Th is time the lu gie hits Nedry rightsmack in  th eface.   
 He SCREAMS and rubs 
it away,frantically. 
 
 Because it hur ts. Likehell.  Nedry falls back,clawing at this  

 eyes, in excruciating pain.  He pulls his hands away, starting to  
 hyperventilate.  He flails his arms in  fron t ofhim, blin kinga mile a  
 minute, but blinded. 
 
 He staggers forward, to tryto 
get into the jeep.  He gets the  
 door open,butSMACKS his head 
on the door frame andcollapses. 
 
 The can of shaving cream flies outof Nedry's jacket pocket --  
 and tumbles into runoff w ater, down the muddy  hillside. Nedry  getsto  

 his feet again and staggers in the 
general direction ofthejeep.  He  
 reaches the open doorand feels his way in. He SLAMS the door. 
 
 There is another HOOT.  From inside the jeep. 
 
 Nedry turns and SCREAMS. The dilo
phosaur is right there, in the  
 passengersseat.  It HISSES louder th
an before, its crestfans angrily,  
 vibrating, reaching a crescendo -- 
  

 - - andthething pounces, SLAMMING Nedryback againstthe  
 driv er's window, SHATTERING it. As Nedryshrieks -- 
 
 Rain and mudwash over the shaving cream can, buryingit.

83 EXT PARK GROUNDS NIGHT 
 
 The rain has all stopped now. GRANT and LEX are at the bottom  
 of the large barrier leading up to 
th e park road. Like it or not,  
 they're inthe parknow, and aresu
rroundedby think jungle foliage on  
 all sides.  They're bothbeaten up
,and Grant's face is covered in  
 blood. 
  
 He's bent over a big puddle, 
splashing water on hisface, 
 rinsing theblood off and tr
ying tobring himself to. 
  
 Poor Lex isscared as hell.  She st ands behindGrant, ramrod  
 straight,her breath coming short, de
sperateGASPS. Her eyes arewide,  
 and she doesn't look like she can move. 
 
 As Grantgets rid ofthe blood, hi
s injurydoesn't look so bad,  

 just a gash on his forehead. 
 
 He turns and looks up to thetr
ee the Explorer fell in.  It's 
 stuck there, nose downin
 thethickest topbranches. 
 
 Lex's GASPS are getting 
louder.  She's terrified. 
 
    GRANT 
  Hey, comeon, don't -- don't -- don't -- just  - -just  
  - - stop, stop. 

 
 He touchesher, but it 's awfully 
awkward, more of a pat on the  
 head th an an ything strong or reassu red. 
 
 But she respondsto the contac
t,hurling herself forward an d  
 throwing her arms tightly aroundhi
s waist.  She clamps here, holding 
 on for dearlife, SOBBING. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 

  Lex, you gotta be quiet, please.  Stop it.  Shhhhh. 
 
 This seemst o quiet her. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Because if we make too much 
noise, he's going tohear us  
  and come back. 
 
 Lex burstsout crying again, a WA
ILING scream, nearly hysterical  
 now.  Grant holds her,no idea what to do. He turns and looks around. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
   (a whispered shout) 
  Timmy?!  Timmy! 
 
 He hears aCRACKINGsound.  He looks up tothe tree again. The  
 Explorer has fallen a few f
eet lower into the branches. 
 

 Grant looksdown at Lex, 
who is sitting on a rock. 
 
    LEX 
  Dad - - Dad - - 
 
    GRANT 
 Shhh - - I'm right  here, L ex.  I'mgoing t o look aft er  
 you.  I'mgoing to help yourbrother.  Iwantyou to  
 stay here and wait for me, okay? 

 
    LEX 
  He left us! He left us! 
 
    GRANT 
  That's notwhat I'm going to do. Good! 
 

 Grant walks to the tree.  Lex scampers into theculvert. 
 
 
84 EXT TREE - NIGHT 
 
 GRANT takes a deep br
eath. grabshold of the first branch,and  
 startshis long climb.  Fortunately, it's agood climbing tree, its  
 branchesthick and regularly spaced. 
 
 Grant moves at a goodpace.  He reaches the car's level, on the  

 driv er's side five or six feet to one side of it. 
 
 The car's in rough shape.  It's much thinner that it usetobe,  
 its n o se completely smash ed in ,th e fron twh eels driven  solidly in to a  
 t hick branch. They are what hold it  in place. 
 
    GRANT 
  Tim?  Tim? 
 

 Grant comes up tothecar and l
ooks in.  TIM is huddled on the  
 floor on the passengerside, frightened,hugging his kneesto his  
 chest. 
 
 He looks up at Grant with a tear and blood-streaked faced.  His  
 voice is barely audible.  
 
    TIM 
  I threw up. 

 
    GRANT 
  That's okay.  Listen, give me yourhand. 
 
 Tim doesn't move. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  I won'ttell anybody you threwup.  Justgive me your  
  hand, okay? 

 
 He reaches out. Tim reaches too,
butthey'restill about a foot  
 apart.  Grant grabs hold ofthe st
eering wheel, topull himself further 
 in.  Thewheel turns. 
 
 On the branch,thefront wheel turn
s, losing a bit of their grip  
 on the thick branch they're restingon. 
 
 Tim and Grant grab hands.  Grant 
holds ontohim, getting an arm  
 securely aroundhis waist.  They 
climb down.Theystop on a branch. 
 
    GRANT 
  Okay,that's not so bad, ahTim? 
 
    TIM 
  Y es it is.  

 
    GRANT 
 It's just like coming out of 
atree house. Did your dad  
 ever build you a treehouse, Tim,eh? 
 
    TIM 
  No. 
 
    GRANT 
  Me too. 

   (he starts to move down) 
  Ok ay . Well, the mainthing aboutclimbing is nev er,  
  never look down, never. 
 
    TIM 
  This is impossible.  How am I going...Ican't make it .   
  This is...it's about fifty feet. 
 
    GRANT 

  So am I going to help you with your foot? 
 
    TIM 
  What if  the car f alls? 
   (or) 
  What if the wheels fall? 
 
 The car GROWNS forward on the 
branch,which sags in their  
 direction.  They  look  up.  The car begins  to shift dramatical ly  tow ards 

 them. 
 
    GRANT 
  Oh,no! GO, Tim, go! Go! 
 
 Theyclimb down, asfast asthey 
can, as the big branchthat is  
 supportingthe carCREAKS, readyto give way any second. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 

  Faster!  Faster! 
 
 The branchbreaks. Disintegra
tes,really, andthe car falls  
 straight at them. 
 
 Grant and Tim let go of the branchthey're on andfall, THUDDING  
 into another branch afew feet down. The carSMACKS into the bug  
 branch they justvacated, and stops there. 
 

 Grant and Tim are half climbing, half falling downthetree now,  
 slipping onthe resin-covered branches, justtrying like hell to get  
 out of the way. 
 
 CREEEE-POW! Thesecond branchbreaks, and now the car SMASHES 
 andCRASHES th rougha network of th inner branches, headed right for  
 them. Ithits open space and goes intofree fall. 

 
 Grant turns, and putsup
 his arms in defense -- 
 
 -- and the car stops, SLAMMING in
to a thick branch just ab ove  
 him. 
 
 Grant looksup, eyeball to eyeball with the fr ont grill. 
 
 Thenew branch startsto CREAK. 
 

 Gran t an d Tim basically fall down  
the rest of the tree, the car  
 BASHING its way through right behind 
them. They jumpthe last sixor  
 seven feet and hit the ground, hard. 
 
 Grant grabs Tim and rolls withhim,
 to the side, just as thecar  
 SMASHES into the earth,nose first, standingupright thatway. 
  
 They lookup in relief, butthe damn thing's still heading for  
 them,now tipping over, falling straight at them, and there's noway  

 theyhavetime to get ou t of th e 
way this time, so Grant just balls  
 himself upon top ofTim to try toprotect him and-- 
 
 --CRASH! The jeep falls on top ofthem. Grant, amazingly  
 unhurt,  looks up confused. 
 
 They're inside the jeepagain,
 saved by the hole sunroof. 
 
 

 CUT TO: 
 
 
85 EXT CULVERT - NIGHT 
 
 LEX is still i n the culv ert, terrified,slow ly  BANGING her head  
 against the wall. 
 
 GRANT is at the mouthof the cu
lvert, carefully studyingthe  
 rinky-dinkmap of thepark hepicked up during the slide show. 
 
    GRANT 
  Okay -- okay -- 
 
 He's tryingto gethis bearings from the crude, cartoon-like  
 drawing onthe map, but it's tough. 
 
 He looks up, picking adirectio
n, and shovesthe map inhis  
 pocket decisively. 
 
 He looks back in at Lex. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Lex, you'regoing tohave to get out ofthere. 
   (he walks towards her) 

  Hiding isn'ta rational solu
tion; wehave to improve our  
  situation. 
 
 She doesn't move.  Grant looks atTim. 
  
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Tim's out here. 
   (Grant picks Tim up) 
  He's okay. 
 

 Still nothing.  Grant tries a new tact. 
 
    GRANT 
   (walking away) 
  'Course you could just wait 
in there while wego back  
  and get help. 
 
    TIM 
   (following Grant) 

  That's a good idea. 
 
    GRANT 
  You'll probably be safeenough (alone) on your own -- 
 
    TIM 
  I doubt it. 
 
    GRANT 

  M aybe -- it's hardto say.  
 
    LEX 
  Liar!  You said youwouldn't leave! 
 
    GRANT 
  I'm tryingto use psychology to get you out ofthe  
  drain, you know! 
 

 She just stares at him like he's
 nuts.  Tim shakes his headat  
 Grant, as ifto say"nice try." Grant calms his tone. 
 
 - --- - VERSION 1 - -- - - 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  We can't go backtheway we
came.  What wehave is a  
  free-rangeT-rex on the road.  There's (there are)  
  fences on either side.  If 
we meet him between here and  
  the lodge,we'dhave problems.  Butwhat this means,  
  what this means, is that  this whole paddock is empty.  
  It's safe. 
 
    LEX 
  It's safe? 
 

    GRANT 
  It's safe. 
 
    LEX 
  It's safe. 
 
    GRANT 
  Go (and) that's theway we're going to go. What do you 
  say? 
 

    LEX 
  Alright. 
 
 - --- - END - -- - - 
 
 - --- - VERSION 2 - -- - - 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Alright. We're just going 
towalk back home. Together. 
 
 We walks over to Lex at the culvert and sits across from her. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Butwe can't walk backon th
e road.  There are fences on 
  either side.  And if wem
eet the Rex between here and  
  the lodge we'd -- haveproblems. 
 
 Lex coversher ears.  Grant tries to calm her. 

 
    GRANT 
  He's probably staked out the road as a feedingground,  
  which means thiswhole paddock
 is empty. It's safe.  
  It's safe, and that'sthewaywe're goin g to go. What  
  do you say? 
 
 - --- - END - -- - - 
 

 He's spoken calmly and confidently, so Lex crawls out ofthe  
 culvert andstands next tohim. 
 
    GRANT 
  Good girl. 
 
 He kisses her hand and helps her crawl out ofthe culvert. 
 
 Tim and Lex nod, andhe starts off in the direction he  

 indicated. Theytrail behind him. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Might be kind of slow,but 
itcan'tbe more than three  
  or four miles.  I'dhoped the rex finished feeding by   
  now, but let's not kid ou
rselves. Did you know a  
  carnivore can eatupto 25% of itsbodyweight in  

  (about) one sitting, sohe's 
probably just ready to move  
  on tothe main course by now-- 
 
 He stops inthe middle of the sent
ence,noticing he's alone.  He  
 turns around. Now both kidshavescampered all the wayback intothe  
 culv ert, terrified. 
 
 
86 EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT 
 

 MULDOONandE LLIE  race down the pa
rk road in an open-topped jeep  
 like the one Nedrytook earlier.  Ne
ither of them speak,they just  
 stare ahead grimly, wondering 
what they're aboutto find. 
 
    MULDOON 
  There they  are! 
 
 They rounda corner and come to
the top of the hill, where the  
 attack took place.  The jeep skid
s to a stop and they jump out. 
 
 The road isrutted, muddy mess. 
 The cementblock house is a  
 pile of rubble.  One of the Expl
orers is gone,the otherstands  
 untouched, both doors hanging open. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Oh, God. Where's the other car? 
 
 She runsto theExplore r. Muldoonfollows, looking around. 

 
 AT THE EXPLORER, 
 
 Ellie leans in and looks around
. Nobody'sthere.  She and  
 Muldoon walk towards the wreckage
 of the outhouse, calling out: 
 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
  I t hink it 's ahead ofus. 
 

    MULDOON 
  It could beanywhere. With the fences out, itcan go in  
  and out of any paddockit likes. 
  
 Theyhear a MOANINGsound fromso
mewhere in the wreckage of the  
 restroom building. They  rush ov er to it. 
 
 IAN MALCOLM lies on his back, se
miconscious among thetwisted  
 wood and cement. 

 
    MULDOON 
  It's Malcolm! 
 
 He shines his light  along t he lengt h ofMa lcolm's body.  His  
 shirt is soaked withblood, buthis 
right leg is even worseoff. The  
 right ankle it bent ou
tward at a strange anglefrom his leg, the  

 trousers flattened, soaked withblood. 
 
 Malcolm's belt has been twisted aroundhis thigh. 
  
    ELLIE 
  He's put a tourniquet on. Ian!  Ian! 
 
 Malcolm GROANS as she touches him, groggy. 
 
    MALCOLM 

  Remind me to talk John for a lovely weekend. 
 
 The T-rex ROARS again.  But closer now. Ellie andMuldoon look  
 at each other. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Canwe chance moving him? 
  
    MALCOLM 

  Please - - chance it . 
 
 Muldoon lays Ma lcolm as carefully as possible in the backof the  
 jeep. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Where are the kids? 
 
 Ellie looks around. 

 
    ELLIE 
  Lex!  Tim! 
 
 She turns and looks back at the 
empty road. She's onthe verge  
 of tears,but is fightingthem back. 
 
    MULDOON 
  Dr. Sattler,I've seen alot of animal attacks. People  

  just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  That's theway it  
  happens. 
 
    ELLIE 
  No, no, no! 
 
 She walksto the edgeof the ro
ad, her eyesfollowing thedeep  
 rutstheExplorer made when itwent
 overtheedge. Muldoon gets ready  
 to leave. 

 
    MULDOON 
  Ellie, com one!! 
 
    ELLIE 
  The other car! 
 

 
87 EXT CLEARING NIGHT 
 
 ELLIE's and MULDOON's flashlightbeams spray light by the base  
 of the tree. 
 
    MULDOON 
  Dr. Grant! 
 
    ELLIE 

  Alan! 
 
 Theyfind the wreckedExplorer. 
 Muldoon peers inside, looking  
 for anything. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Do you see anything? 
 
    MULDOON 

  I don't know. 
 
 The T- rex ROARS again, closer still 
 
 Ellie nervously goes tothe othe
r side of the car and looksin. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Alan?! 
 

    MULDOON 
  They're not here. 
 
 Ellie desperately searches the gr
oundfor any signs of Grant.   
 She finds their footprints. 
 
    ELLIE (O.S.) 
  Thank God. 
 

 
88 EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT 
   
 MALCOLM, laid out in the back
 of the jeep, feels something  
 strange. He looks down, at  the on
e of the T -rex footprints in the  
 road.  It's filled withwater. 
 
 Thewater in the puddle 
vibrates rhythmically. 
 

 Malcolm's eyes widen. He
 looks around, fran tically. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Uh - - anybody?  Anybody hearthat? 
 
 
89 EXT CLEARING NIGHT 

 
 EL L IE is st ill looking around, t o MULDOON'schagrin.  Her  
 flashlight falls on three sets offootprints in the mud. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Look! 
 
 Wit her flashlight, she follows thetrail the footprints made.   
 They lead into the jungle and disappear. 
 

 
90 EXT PARK ROAD NIGHT 
 
 MALCOLM's starin g , wide-eyed, at the rings in the water, which  
 are gettingbigger now. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  It's  a-  - animpact tremor is w hat it is, it,uh- - 
 

 BOOM.  BOOM. 
 
    MALCOLM (cont'd) 
  I'm fairly alarmed here! 
 
 ELLIE andMALCOLMcome up over the embankment, excited. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Gotta move, gotta getout of 
here.  Let's go-we gotta  
  go, we gotta get out of
 here, rightnow!  Go, go!  Let'shurry, let's  
  get out of here! 
 
 They st op talking.  
The BOOMING is louder now, andfaster.  Much  
 faster. They look back
, over their shoulders. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Oh. 
 

 Ellie and Muldoon get into the 
jeep, Muldoon in thedriver's  
 seat. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Move now! Let's go, let'
s go, right now, rightnow! 
 
 The tyrannosaur SMASHE
S out of the jungle foliage, bursts onto  
 the road, and runs straight atthem
, movingat least thirty miles an 
 hour. 

 
    MALCOLM 
  GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO! 
 
 Muldoonfumbles for the keys, tu
rns the jeep over, and SLAMS it  
 into gear. He drops the clutch, hi
ts the gas, and tears ass out of  
 there. 

 
 But the jeep is slow towork 
through the firstfew gears. 
 Terrified, E llie dares to look down,to the side view mirror, which  
 tells her "Objects Are Closer ThanThey Appear." 
 
 Andthey sure are.  The T- rex  is stil l gaining on theslow ly   
 accelerating jeep.  All three of them
 stare back atthe rex in terror - 
 - 
 
    ELLIE 

  Faster, faster! 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Must gofaster, it's getting closer -mustgo faster! 
 
    ELLIE 
  Faster! Shit, shit, shit, faster! 
 
    MALCOLM 

  Must gofaster, go, go. Open itup, 5th gear, 5th gear!   
  Here it comes!  Stand on it! Fifth -stand on it,5th  
  gear, go! 
 
 - -which means they don'tsee the half-fallen tree branchright  
 in f ront of them, blocking  the path
 of the road. Muldoon looks back  
 first, SHOUTS - - 
 
    MULDOON 

  DOWN! 
 
 - -they all duck. 
 
 Thewindshield hits thebranch 
and SHATTERS as the jeep flies  
 ahead, really pickingup speed now. 
 
 The T-rex just runs rightth
rough th e bran ch
, SMASHING it  
 entirely. 

 
 They're bounced around pretty badly. Malcolm is knocked into  
 the front, and in so doing knocks the gear shift intoneutral.   The  
 engine RACES,theT-rex closes inagain - - 
   
 Losing ground now, 
the dinosaur makes a finallunge for the jeep  
 andCRUNCHES intothe left rear quarter panel - - 
 
    ELLIE 

  Faster, faster! 
 
 - -but Muldoon SLAMSit back intogear and guns it. The T-rex  
 gives up, fading 
into the distance. 
 
 Th eydrive in  silen ce fo r a few momen ts, all scared ou t of th eir  
 wits. 

 
    MALCOLM 
  Thinkthey'll havethat on the tour? 
 
 
91 EXT PARK GROUND NIGHT 
 
 GRANT,LEX, and TIM make their 
way throughJurassic Park. Far  
 in the distance,there's another ROAR.  Granthears it, but tries not  
 to show it. 

 
    LEX 
  Hear that? 
   (or) 
  Are you hearing this? 
 
    GRANT 
  No, I didn'thear anyt hing. 
   (or) 

  No, we're okay. 
 
 Theykeepwa lking, but  now Grant is looking aroundfor asafe  
 place to hide.  He looks up, tothetowering trees around them. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  You(guys)both look pretty tired. I think 
   (or) 
  why don't we find 

   (or) 
  we ought to find someplace to rest. 
 
 He hears another ROAR 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 
  Like aboutnow. C'mon! Hurry up! Like this tree. 
 
    LEX 

  Why are we hurrying ifthere'snothing wrong? 
 
    TIM 
  What ifwefall?  I hate trees. 
 
 
92 EXT TREE NIGHT 
 
 LEX,TIM, and GRANT climb.  Grant is behind,watching the other  

 two, givingthem a push
 upwhen theyneed it. 
 
    TIM 
  I hate trees! 
 
    LEX 
  They don't bother me. 

 
    TIM 
  Yeah,youweren't in that last one. 
 
 Now, near the top of the tree, 
the three of them sit there,  
 dangling their legs, looking out over the park. 
 
 It's an incredible view. Theycansee in all directions. And  
 with thefull moon,there's a lot ofdetail. 
  

 Most striking of all are dozens of sauropod heads, at theend of  
 long necks,that towerover the park. 
 
    TIM (cont'd) 
  Hey!  Those are brontosauruses- -I mean, those are  
  brachiosauruses. 
 
    GRANT 
  It's okay tocall them brontosaurs,Tim.  It's agreat  

  name.  It'sa romanticname.  It means "thunder lizard". 
 
    TIM 
   (digging that) 
  "Thunder lizard!" 
 
 Grant findsa solid web of branch and settles himse lf in it, 
 leaning back againstthe trunk of the tree,with a little room on  
 either side of him. Lexnestles upnext tohim on the branch. Grant is  

 surprised, but accepts it. 
 
 Tim climbs off to the side, to a nook  in the branch ofhis ow n.   
 Silent of amoment, the three canhear
 the HOOTS oftheanimals as they  
 call.  Some are almost musical. 
 
    GRANT 
  Listen tothat! They're singing! 
   (he movesover to ahigher branch) 

  Of courseno one's ever heard one from a dinosaur  
  before, but - - I could swear t hat  sounds  suspiciously  
  to me like a mating call (to me).  In an all-female  
  environment - - 
   (or) 
  On an all- gi rl island? 
 
 He smiles, enchanted. He HOOTS 
himself, trying to imitate one  
 of the calls.  Immediately, five or six of the heads turn in their  

 direction and HOOT back. 
 
    LEX 
  No, no, sh,sh,sh -- stop!  Stop!Stop! Don't let the  
  monsters come over here! 
 
    LEX 

  They're not monsters, Lex. 
They'rejust animals.  And  
  these are herbivores. 
 
    TIM 
  That means they only eat vegetables.  Butforyou, I  
  thinkthey'd make an exception. 
 
    GRANT 
  Tim, Tim, Tim.... 
 

    LEX 
  Oh, I hate the other kind. 
 
    GRANT 
  They're just doing what they do. 
   (or) 
  Well the other kind -- 
   (he gets off thebranchand goes back to sit with  
   the kids) 

  - - just dowhat they do. 
 
    LEX 
  Dorkatops! 
 
    TIM 
  Straight-A brainiac! 
 
    GRANT 

  Could you guyspossibly cool thatfor a -- 
 
 Satisfied, Tim settles in for the night.  Grant shifts too,  
 getting comfortable, but something 
in his pocket pincheshim.  He  
 winces anddigs it out. It's the 
velociraptor claw 
he unearthed so  
 long ago inMontana 
 
 Yesterday,actually.  He looks at it, thinking  amillion  
 thoughts, staring at this thing thatused to beso priceless. 

 
    LEX 
  What areyou gonnadonow ifyoudon't haveto dig of  
  dinosaur bones any more? 
 
    GRANT 
  I guesswe'll just have to evolve too. 
 
    TIM 

  Whatdo you call a blind dinosaur? 
 
    GRANT 
  I don't know. What do you call a blind dinosaur?

 Grant laughs.  Bothk ids finally
 clo se their eyes, but aftera

hers open again.

    GRANT 
  I'll stay awake.

  All night .

94 INTRESTAURANT NIGHT 
 
 ELLIE comes into the darkened re
staurant,following the source  
 of the flickering light.  A candle burns at a table in thecorner.  
 
 JOHN HAMMOND sitsat the table, al
one. There is a bucket of ice  
 cream in the middle, an dhe's eati
ng adish of it, staringdown  
 morosely. 
 
 Ellie drawsup to the table and Hammond looks up at her.  His  
 eyes are puffy,his hair is messed up -- for the first time we've seen  
 him, thefire is gone from his eyes. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  They were all melting. 
   (or) 

  It  wa s all melt ing. 
 
 Ellie just nods. 
  
    ELLIE 
  Malcolm's okay for now.  Igavehim a shot ofmorphine. 
 

    HAMMOND 
  They'll all be fine.  Who better to get thechildren  
  through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert? 
 
 Ellie nods. Another pause. Hammond breaksit again. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  Youknow  the first attraction I ever built when I came 
  down south from Scotland? 
Wasa Flea Circus, Petticoat 
  Lane. Really quitewonderful. Wehad awee trapeze, a  

  roundabout- - a merry-go - - whatyou call it? 
 
    ELLIE 
  Carousel. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  A carousel - - and aseesaw
.  They all moved, motorized 
  of course, but people woul
d sweartheycould see the  
  fleas.  "Isee thefleas, mummy! Can'tyou see the  

  fleas?" Clown fleas,highwire fleas, fleas onparade... 
   (he trails off) 
 
  Ellie just looks at him,not su
rewhat his state is.  He goes 
  on. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Butwith this place, I -- 
Iwanted to give (show)them 
  something real, something 
that wasn't an illusion,  
  something they could see 
an d (feel) to uch.  An aim  
  devoid of (without) merit. 
 
    ELLIE 
  But you can't thinkthrough this one.  Youhave to feel 
  it. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  You're absolutely right.  
Yes, you're right. Hiring  
  Nedry wasa mistake, that
's obvious.  We're over- 
  dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's  
  all correctable for thenexttime around. 
 
    ELLIE 
  John, John. John,you're still building onto that Flea  
  Circus,that illusion.  Andnow you're adding onto it by  
  what you're doing here.  That's theillusion. 
 

 
    HAMMOND 
  (When) Once we have control again we - - 
 
    ELLIE 
  Control?! You neverhad control!  I was overwhelmed by 
  the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I  

  didn't have enough respect 
forthat power, and it's out  
  now. You're sitting here trying topick upthepieces.   
  John, there's nothingworth picking up. The only thing  
  that matters now are the peop
le we love.  Alan,Lex, and 
  Tim.  And John, they're out 
therewhere people are dying  
  - -people are dying,you know? 
 
 There is a long pause.  Hammondavoids hergaze.  Ellie reaches  
 out and takes a spoonout of one of 
the buckets of ice 
cream, and licks  
 it.  Finally :  

 
    ELLIE (cont'd) 
  It's good. 
 
 He looks up ather, and his face isdifferent, as theunhappy  
 irony ofwhat he's aboutto say finally hits home. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Spared no expense.

96 EXT PARK DAWN 
 
 The su n comes up over JurassicPa
rk. The danger ofthenight  
 before is overcome by the sheer beau
ty oftheplace - - it really is  
 like the Serengeti Plain. 
 
 Over at theedge of a great op
en field, a huge tree marks the  
 border between the open  area
 andthe thick ofthe jungle. 
 
 UP IN THETREE, 
  
 GRANT,TIM, and LEX ar
e asleep in thebranches of the tree, both  
 kids now curled up un der Grant's arms. 

 
 A heavy shadow falls over all th
ree of them,blocking out the  
 sun entirely.  Grant awakens, 
onlya little bit asleep,  as - - 
 
 - - a brachiosaur'shead pushes 
into the treebranches, rightup  
 beside them.  It hesi
tates therefor a second, seemingly staring at 
 them. Grant just watches as it op
ens its mouth very 
wide andCHOMPS  
 down on abranch over their heads. 
 

 The kids awakenwith a start. Tim poin ts, Lexopens hermouth  
 to scream,butnothing comes out.  Then- - 
 
    LEX 
  Go away! 
 
    GRANT 

   (quietly) 
  It's okay! It 's okay! It's a brachiosaur! 
 
    TIM 
  Veggiesaurus, Lex, Veggiesaurus! 
 
 But Lex isn't taking any chances 
and scrambles back, away from  
 its mouth.Tim and Grant cometogeth
er on the branch, 
just staring at  
 the dinosaur in wonderas it eats its breakfast. 
  

 Grant getsanother branch. 
 
 Tim scampers up, trying to get th e brachiosaur's attention. 
 
    TIM (cont'd) 
  Come here, boy- - I mean girl. 
   (he tries  whistling) 
 
 Grant moves forward and tries to
feed the brachiosaur. The  
 animal gets the end ofthe branch 
and starts a tug-of-warwith Grant. 
 
 Tim t ries t o help him - - t hey re
ally begin to have a goodtime  
 with the brachiosaur. 
 
 HONK! The brachiosaur makes a loud honking noise, startling  
 Grant and the kids. 
 
    GRANT 

  Take a bite, take abite.  I'mnot letting go. 
 
    TIM 
  It's sostrong! Look at its nose. 
   (he grabs onto the branch) 
  Need help? 
 
 Tim reaches out, petting the dinosaur'sheadwhile it chews. 
 

    TIM (cont'd) 
  That's a girl.  HeyLex,you cantouch it. It's a girl,  
  just like you. Come on , it's okay.  Lex, come on an d  
  touch it. Itlikes you.  It's gotta like you. Come on  
  Lex . Lex , come ov er and touch - - it's  a girl, it has  
  to like you. Lex, whydon'tyou touch it. Ithas to  
  lik e y ou.  It's a girl. 
 
    GRANT 

  Come on, try so
me. Take a bite. 
 
    TIM 
  It's goodprotein. Come on,Lex.Why don't you touch  
  it?  Look athis nose. 
 
    GRANT 

  T his is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! 
  Just think of it as a bigcow. Lookat it's teeth? 
   (he moves in closer) 
  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seventonanimal.   
  Just think of it as a bigcow! 
 
 Grant maneuvers in closer.  He re
aches out and grabshold ofthe  
 thing's lip with both hands and pulls it down, revealing thejaw at  
 work. 
 

    LEX 
  I like cows. 
 
    GRANT 
  You're abeautiful big animal. 
 
    TIM 
  His nose is running. Itlooks like it has acold. 
 

 The dinosaur keeps chewing,no
t objecting to the inspection. 
  
    TIM 
  Did you smell that? 
 
 Lex  tentatively  edges forw ard in the tree to theinspection. 
 
    LEX 
  Come on girl, uphere. 

 
 She barely touchesthething on the tip of itsnose - -

 dripping wet fromhead to toe. 
 
    TIM 
  God bless you!

97 ON THE GROUND, 
 
 Lex,her shirt is soaked, and face all wet, walks away from the  
 tree.  Tim and Grant follow. 
 

    TIM 
  Oh, great. Now she'll never try anything new! 
 
 Lex is embarrassed and ticked off. 
 
    TIM (cont'd) 
  She'll just sit in her room 
andnever come outand play  

  withher computer - -

   at Tim) 
  I'm a hacker! 
 
    TIM 
  That'swhat I said! You're
 a nerd! Theydon'tcall you  
  people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds! 

 
 Tim and Lex  continue talk ing, obliv ious  to Grant, whohas  
 stopped by a tree roottrunk. 
 
    TIM 
  Hey Lex, ahhhchooo! 
   (or) 
  Hey Lex, com here. 
 

    LEX 
  What? 
 
    TIM 
  Hey Lex,you forgot tosay gazu ndheit. 
 
 Grant  is st ill crouchingon the 
ground below the tree where he  
 land ed, staring at something inthe palm of  his hand. They both come  
 and look over his shoulder, curiou
s.  They stare in amazement - - 
 
 - - at awhole clutch ofdinosaur eggs! All hatched,now empty.   
 Grant picksup one ofthe fragments,
 a large one - nearly half an egg. 
 
    GRANT 
  Youknowwhatthis is? It's a dinosaur egg.  The  
  dinosaurs are breeding. 
 
    TIM 

   (taking the shell from him) 
  But - - mygrandpa said all the dinosaurswere girls. 
 
    GRANT 
  Amphibian DNA. 
 
    LEX 
  What's that? 
 

    GRANT 
  Well, on the tour- - the film said they usedfrog DNA  
  to fill in thegene sequence gaps. T hey mutated the  
  dinosaur's genetic code an
d blended it with that of  
  frogs. Now, some West Afri
can frogs have been knownto 
  spontaneously change sex fr
om male to female, in a  
  single sex environment.  Malcolm was right! Look, life  

  found a way! 
 
 
98 INTCONTROL ROOM DAY 
 
 The mood in  th e roomis hopeless.  MALCOLM, his wounds bandaged, 
 but in real pain, hangsaroundwith
 ELLIE andMULDOON,hoping forsome  
 development  while RAYARNOL D is st ill at  t hecomput er t erminal and  
 looking a mess, he doggedly sortsth
roughthe computersystem's lin es  
 of code. One.  By one.  By one.
 They BLIP by, reflected in his  
 glasses.  He turns and stares up at
 HAMMOND with a look of absolute  
 incredulity on hisface. 
 
    ARNOLD 
  No, no,no,that's crazy, you're out of your mind,he's  
  absolutely out of his mind - -  
 
    ELLIE 
  Wait a minute.  What exactly doesthis mean? 

 
 Hammond turns toher, the 
twinkle back in hiseye. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  We're t a lking, my dear, ab
out a calculated risk, which  
  is the onlyoption left to us.  Wewill never find the  
  command NEDRYused.  He covered his tracks far toowell,  
  and Ithink it's obvioushe'snot coming back. So  
  shutting down the system - - 

 
    ARNOLD 
  I will n o t do it. Yo u ' ll have to  get somebody else,  
  because I will not. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  - -shuttingdown the system is theonly way to  
  guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understan d  
  correctly , all the sy stem w ill come back  ontheir  

  original start-up modes correct? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  Theoretically,yeah (yes), but we've never shut downthe 
  whole system.  It maynot come back at all. 
 
    ELLIE 
  But would we get the phones back? 
 

    ARNOLD 
  Yeah, again, in theory, but - - 
 
    MULDOON 
   (desperate) 
  What about the lysine contingency?  We couldputthat  
  into effect! 

 
    ELLIE 
  What's that? 
 
    HAMMOND 
  It's absolu tely out of the question. 
 
 Hammond walks awayfrom thegroup. 
 
    ARNOLD 

  The lysine cont ingency- it 's int ended t o prevent t he  
  spread of the animals is case they ever got offthe  
  island, butwe coulduse it now. Dr. Wu inserted a gene  
  that makesa single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.  
  An imals can ' t manu factu re th e amin o acid lysin e.  Un less 
  they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll  
  go into a coma and die. 
 
    ELLIE 

  How would we cut offthe ly sine? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  No trick  to it. Just stop runningthe program. Leav ing  
  them unattended. 
 
 Malcolm speaks up. 
 
    MALCOLM 

  How soonbefore theybecome comatose? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  It would betotally painless -- they'd just slip into  
  uncon sciousn ess and they die. 
  
    MALCOLM 
  How long before theyslip into unconsciousness? 
 

    ARNOLD 
  About- - seven days,more or less. 
 
    ELLIE 
  Seven days?!  Seven days?! Oh, great.  Oh good - -  
  clever. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Th at' ll - it' dbe a first;man  an d din o sau r all die  

  together.  John's plan. 
   (he raises a hand) 
 
 Hammond finally loses his cool. He BELLOWS,summoning every  
 ounce of authority at his comma
nd.  Andthat's quite a bit. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  PEOPLE ARE DYING! 
 
 There is amoment inwhich no one dares to speak.  Hammond  
 regains himself. 
 
    HAMMOND (cont'd) 
  Will you please sh
ut down the system. 
  
 Arnold swallows an
d gets tohis feet. 
 

    ARNOLD 
  You asked for it - - 
 
 He wa lks slowly across t he roomto a red metal box on the wa ll.   
 He takes akey fromhis belt, 
unlocks the door, and opens it. 
 
 There is a row of four switches in side.  He flips them off, on e  
 by one, leaving only asingle lever left . 
 

 His handhovers over it. .. andhe flips the lever. 
 
    ARNOLD (cont'd) 
  - - andyougot it. 
 
 Every monitor, every terminal, 
every fluorescent light shuts  
 out.plunging them into near-darkness. 
 
 They justsit in eerie stillness for a moment. 

 
    ELLIE 
   (hushed voice) 
  How  long w ill this tak e? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  'Bout thirty seconds. 
 
 Theywait, in tense silence. Hammond adjusts thewilting silk  

 handkerchief inhis breast pocket . 
He notices Malcolm staring at him,  
 his eyes full of disapproval. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  I think perhaps I'll justsi
t down. Idon't suppose you 
  t hink all t hat  much of me now, doyou? 
 
    MALCOLM 
  You're all right, JohnYou're
 okay. It's justyou don't  
  have intelligence. Youhave "thinktelligence."  You  
  thinknarrowly and call it 
"beingfocused." You don't  
  see the consequences. You're very good atsolving  
  problems, at getting answers - -but you just  don'tknow  
  the right questions. 
 
    ELLIE 

  Ian - - 
 
 Malcolm looks at her. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  Yes? 
 
    ELLIE 
  - - shut up. 
 

    MALCOLM 
  Yes. 
   (to Hammond) 
  It'snot acriticism, by the way. 
 
 Finally, Arnold turns back to the box. He flips the row of  
 safety sw itches back again, th
enhesitates bythe main swit ch. 
 
    ARNOLD 

  Hold on toyour butts. 
 
 He throws it.  Andnothinghappens. There is avery long pause. 
 
    MALCOLM 
  It's not working. 
 
    ARNOLD 
  Uh - - 

 
    MULDOON 
  Listen,which of you knowshowtohandle a gun? 
 
 Arnold, who can't quite understandthis, racesover to themain  
 monitor 
 
    ARNOLD 
   (joyously) 

  HAH!  It's ok ay! It's okay! Look! See that?! LOOK! 
 
 Theystareat the monitor, whichglows with afaint amber light,  
 the only mechanical thing inthe room that's on. The lefthand corner  
 of the screen displays two words -- 
 
 /system ready. 
 
 Arnold looks atthem,his face triumphant. 

 
    ARNOLD (cont'd) 
  It's on!  It worked! 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Thatw ill teach y outo trus t Grandpa. 
 

    MALCOLM 
  Wait a minute?  Wh atdo you mean "worked"? Everything 
  is still off! 
 
    ARNOLD 
  The shutdown must have tr
ipped the circuit breakers.  
  All we haveto do is turn them back on, reboot a few  
  systems inhere - - the phon
es, security doors, half a  
  dozen others -- but it
 worked!  System ready! 
 

    MULDOON 
  Where are the breakers? 
 
    ARNOLD 
  Out in the maintenance sh
ed.  Other side of the  
  compound. I'll go out th er
e.  Three minutes,and I can  
  have the power back 
on in the entire park. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Just to be safe, I'd liketo have everybody inthe  
  emergencybunker until Mr. Ar

  system is back on its feet again.

96D EXT PARK GROUNDS DAY 

 
 GRANT,TIM, and LEX walk throughthe park grounds,heading  
 across a relatively open ar

    TIM & LEX 
  I'm tired, and I'm hungry. 
 WhenI get back I'm gonna 
  have peanuts and...etc. 
 
    GRANT 

  The visitor's center should 
be justabout a mile beyond  
  that rise.  If wekeep -- 
  
 The ANIMAL C RY theyheard earlie
r is closer now, loud er, and  
 repeated by many more 
animals.  Grant looksup. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 

  What isthat? Can you 
tell me what they are? 
 
    TIM 
  Gallimimus. 
 
 He turns around, toface the direction the sound is comingfrom.  
 He squints. The AN IMAL CRY aremuch
 louder now,  accompanied by a low  
 rumble. 
 
    TIM (cont'd) 

  Here - - they're flocking thisway. 
 
 Grant takes a few steps forward.  
As hewatches, he can make out  
 shapes inthe distance. 
 
 Dinosaurs. Dozens ofthem.  
All at once,hefigures it  out. 
 
    GRANT 
  STAMPEDE! 

 
 Andthat's exactly whatit is, 
a stampede of at least forty  
 dinosaurs,Gallimimus by name.  Lex 
is readyto get out of there, but 
 Grant and Tim hesitate, staring. 
 
 The dinosaurs kickup a flock of 
birds,which startles them, and  
 theycall change directio
n at once,the sameway. 
 
    GRANT (cont'd) 

  Look atthewheeling - - theuniform direction change!   
  Like a flockof birds evading a predator! 
 
 Sure enough,they hear a ROAR, the veryfamiliar roar - - 
 - - of Tyrannosaurus rex. 
 
    GRANT 
  Oh, sh it. 
 

 Grant and the kidswhirl at the sound,but can't place it, as it  
 seems to come from all aroundthem.  They look back towards the  
 stampede.  The herd spontaneously 
changes direction again, andnow 
 they'reheaded straight at them. 
 
 The three of them take off, acrossthe meadow,toward the  
 relative cover of the jungle.  It's
 areal footrace, but the herd is  
 far faster, and Grant knows th
ey're not going to make it. 
 

 They jumpover a huge root networ
k. There'sa space under it to  
 hide, and Grant stops the kids,shov
es them underneath,then follows  
 them. They cover their heads as 
the herd THUNDERS over the roots. 
 
 Chunks of everything fly everywhere as theherd plows overhead,  
 their clawed feet striking the root
sdangerously close to Grant andthe  
 kids. 

 
 Finally, they  pass. Grant peersup, over the top root. He looks  
 toward thetrees, which thehe
rd isnow running alongside. 
 
 A ROAR comes from somewhere within the trees. 
 
 Grant scans thetrees, looking 
for any sign of the T-rex -- 
 
 - - andthen it  bursts out, ahead oftheherd, cutting themoff,  
 throwing them into disarray,
 scattering themeverywhere. 
 
 They all stare as the rex kicks it
 into overdrive, runs downone  
 of the Gallim imus, and sinks its teeth into itsneck. 
 
 The T-rexmakes thekill in a cloud of dust and debris. 
 
 Tim and Granthalf rise to 
their feet, staring in wonder. 
 
    LEX 

  I wanna go- -now! 
 
 But Grant and Tim aretransf
ix ed,watching the T-rex. 
 
    GRANT 
  Watch how it eats! 
 
    LEX 
  Please! 

 
    GRANT 
  Bet you'll never look at birds thesame way again! 
 
  Tim nods in fascination.  Th e T-
rexpauses inthe middle of its  
  meal and ROARS. 
 
    LEX 
  Let's go! 

 
    GRANT 
  Okay. Keep low. Follow me. 
 
 She turns and takes off, running as fast as she can, across the  
 open plain. Tim and Granttear
 themselves away and followher.

  Something's happened.  Something wentwrong. 
 
 MULDOON paces too.  HAMMOND and MALCOLM are also crammed in the

  Okay. 
 

 MuldoonCLANGS opena steel cabi

 Grant looksup at the fence. It

    GRANT 
  It's a bit ofa climb.  You guys think you canmake it? 
 
    TIM 
  Nope. 

 
    LEX 
  Way too high. 
 
 Grant grabs a stick and climbs up on the ledge.  He looks at the  
 warning light on the fence. It's out. He pokes thewire with a stick.  
 No sparks fly 
  
    GRANT 

  Well, I guess that means the power's off. 
 
 Still not trusting the fence,he taps it with his foot.  He  
 moves in slowly and lays bothhand

 around it.

 They start down the path, moving quickly. 
 
 
102A EXT PATH DAY 
 
 MULDOONandELLIE emerge from one

 more open area.  The huge raptor 
pen standssilently, surrounded and  
 penetratedby jungle, the abandoned 
goon toward looming over it like a  
 haunted house. 
 
 Muldoon slow s dow n,Elli e right next tohim. They notice a hole  
 in thefence that surroundsthe raptor pen. 
 
 The metal is twisted, as if gnawed, thehole is large enough for  
 an animal to slip through. 
 
    ELLIE 

  Oh my God.  Aw, God. 
 
    MULDOON 
 The shutdown must have turned off all the fences.  
 Goddamn it! EvenNedry knewbe

 He squats near the hole, looking 
atthe ground.  He sees three

 different directions, bu t all in  the jungle foliage on either side of  
 them. 
 
    MULDOON 
  C 'mon on, this way.

  No. We can't. 

 
    ELLIE 
  Why not? 
 
    MULDOON 
  Because we're being hunted. 
 From thebushes straight

 Muldoon raises his weapon slowly to his shoulder. 
 
    MULDOON 
  Run, towards the shed.  I've got her. 
 
 Ellie backsup,down the path,

 and open.  She crawls inside,  silently.  
  
 Tim sees the raptors make thetu
rn towards Lex, SMASHING more  
 stuff around with their tails.  He turns and sees a walk-infreezer in  

 the far wall, with a pin-locking handle. 
 
 As Lextries to pull theoverhead door to the cabinet shut, one  
 of the raptors rounds acorner and 
sees her reflection on a shiny  
 cabinet front. Lextries frantica
lly to lower thecabinet door, but  
 it's stuck. 
 
 Tim takes a few deep breathes, su
mmons wh at little strengthhe  
 has left - -  

 
 - - and makes a break for thewalk-in freezer. He's limping,  
 dragging himself, really moving like a woun ded preynow, and- - 
 
 - -the other raptor spots him. Both raptors go into a pre- 
 attackcrouch - - 
 
 - - andthey pounce, one towards each of the kids. 
 

 Lex tugs on thecover,to the avail - -Tim's raptor charges  
 after him, just openfloor space betweenthem - - 
 
 - - andLex's raptor THUDS into ashiny surface bearing hr  
 reflection.  It chased the wrong image.  It sags to thefloor,  
 semiconscious. 
 
 At the other end of theaisle, th
e real Lex SCREAMS as theother  
 raptor bears down on Tim. Tim reache
s the freezer, rips the door open,  
 and f alls inside.  Thef loor is cold and slick and his f eetgoright  
 outfrom under him.  He sprawls ac
ross the floor, rolls out oftheway  
 - - 
 
 - - andtheraptor slips and falls
 into thefreezer too, right 
 past him. 
 
 Tim drags himself to his  feet and out of the freezer. 
 

 The raptormakes one last lunge, 
right on Tim's heels, itsmouth  
 wide open - - 
   
 - - but Lex SLAMS the door shut 
just asTim is clear.  The 
 raptor's head is caughtfor a second, but it SNARLS, retreats, and  
 Lex's gets the door shut all the way. 
 

 The raptorROARS andSCREAMS in
side. Lex jams thepin through  
 the handle, locking it in. 
 
 Nowthe other raptor staggers to
 is feet. Groggy, it SMASHES  
 into stuff all over the kitchen. Lex throwsher arms around Tim again  
 for supportand theytake off. 
 
 
128 INT RESTAURANT DAY 
 

 TIM and LEX hurry across the restaurant. They stare back over  
 their shoulders as theyrun.  
They CRASH into GRANT and ELLIE. 
 
    LEX 
  It's in there! 
 
    ELLIE

130 INT CONTROL ROOM DAY 
 

 The door to thecontrolroom SMACKS open.  GRANT, ELLIE, an dthe

 Grant moves Tim to the side, and ra
ces backto the doorto lock it. 
 
    LEX 
  We can  call for h elp?! 
 
    ELLIE 
  We've gotto reboot the systemfirst! 

 
 She sits at the computer and st
udies the screen.  It'sflashing  
 to her, dominated by  amaze- lik e grid.  She studies it, confused. 
 
    GRANT 
   (at the door) 
  Oh,no! The door lock s -  - Ellie!  Boot up thedoor  
  locks!  Boot up the door locks! 
 

 POW! Somethinghits the door, hard, fromtheoutside, the kids  
 SCREAM, Granthurls his back against 
it- - Grant loses his gun.  He 
 struggles.  The raptor scratches his head. 
 
    ELLIE 
  ALAN! 
 

 - - andEllie leaps out of the chair and races over to the door  
 to help him.  A raptor SNARLS an
dSNAPS, RAMMING itself against the  
 door, try ing to force itsw ay  into the control room.  It's all Ell ie  
 and Grant can doto hold the door 
against theonslaugh
t, but it bucks  
 against them viciously. 
 
    GRANT 
   (to Ellie) 
  Ellie - - getback and boot up the door locks! 
 

    ELLIE 
  You can't hold it by yourself! 
 
    GRANT 
  Ellie, get the gun! 
   (or) 
  Try to reach thegun! 
 
    ELLIE 

  I can't get it! 
   (or) 
  I can't get it unless I move! 
 
 OVER AT THE COMPUTER, 
 
 Lex slides quickly into the command chair atNedry's terminal.   
 She staresat the screen for a moment - - 
 

    LEX 
  This is a Unix system. I knowthis. It'sthefile s for  
  thewhole park.  It's like 
a phone book --it tells you  
  everything. 
 
 - - andthen her fingersstart to flyover thekeyboard. Tim  
 watches, amazed, asthe computer startsto respond to Lex's commands. 
 
    LEX (cont'd) 

  I've gotto find the right file.  Ohno, this isn't 
  right. Thismight be right, no thisisn't it. 
 
    TIM 
  C'mon, Lex!  C'mon, Lex! Go, Lexie! 
 
 Reaching another menu,Lex spots a box onthe screen that reads  
 "DOOR INTEGRITY." She reachesout 
and touches it. The screen BEEPS -  
 - 

 
    LEX 
  There it is,I got it! This is it, I didit.  Yes, yes!  
 
 - - andthedoor latch panel BUZZES.  Grant andEllie put 
 everythingtheyhave into it and finally the door SNICKS shut, locking  
 the raptor outside. 

 
    GRANT 
  What works? 
 
    LEX 
  Phone security systems, everythingworks. You askfor 
  it, w e got it! 
 
 
 CUT TO: 

 
 
131 INT BUNKER DAY 
 
 A phone RINGS.  HAMMOND andMALCOLM look at each other, wide- 
 eyed.  Hammond lunges for it. 
 
    HAMMOND 
  Grant?! The children alright? 

 
 
132 INT CONTROL ROOM DAY 
 
 All t he screens in the cont rol room ha vecome alive now,and  
 data is scrolling by at incredible speed as every remaining system is  
 the park comes back on line. ELLIE is at the keyboard with LEXnow, 
 figuring things out, andGRANT is on the phone. 
 

    GRANT 
  The children are fine. 
 
 
133 INT CONTROL ROOM DAY 
 
 HAMMOND is onthephone, MALCOLM is trying to listen. 
 
    HAMMOND 

  Thank God. 
 
    GRANT (o.s.) 
  Listen, the phones are back
up! Call the mainland!   
  Tell them to sendthedamn helicopters -- 
 
 Suddenly Grant st ops in the middl
e of his sentence. A SCREAM  
 cuts in,then three GUNSHOTS,fast
, and a hor r ible C LUNKING asthe  
 phone is dropped. 

 
    HAMMOND 
  Grant!  GRANT! 
 
 But there'sno answer. 
 
 

134 INT CONTROL ROOM DAY 
 
 Grant's rifle lies on thefloor, 
smok ing,sev eral spent shells  
 alongside it.  The frontwindow of
 the control room has three huge  
 impact shatter patterns in  the glass, wh ere th egunshots hit. 
 
 TIM goes into an openpanel through the ceiling , and into the  
 crawl space.  LE X climbs the ladder, followed by ELLIE and GRANT. 
 
 Grant looksover to thefrontwindow,scared as hell, justas -  

 - 
 
 - - itSHATTERS in a shower of glass and a raptor EXPLODES into  
 the control room.  It lands on its 
feet on awork stationconsole,  
 images from wall projectors fallin g across itsh ead. 
 
 Grant vaults himself up into the ceiling, and knocks the ladder  
 with his feet. 
 

 The raptortilts its head curiously, looking up at the swaying  
 ceiling. 
 
 
135 IN THE CRAWL SPACE, 
 
 Grant, Ellie, and the kids da
sh across the ceiling panels,  
 moving fast, but carefully, so
 asnot to break th rough. 
 

 SMASH! The raptor's head bursts through a panel behind them,  
 leaping upat them, SNARLING and SNAPPING. 
 
 It drops down again, and theykeep moving forward. Butnow it  
 ERUPTS through a panel right in front of them.  They SCREAM, itsteeth  
 CLICK just inches in from ofEllie - - 
 
 - -but the raptor can'thold itself up there, and it falls back  
 to the floor of the control room. 

  
 Grant looks around frantically an
d spots an air duct a fewyards  
 away. 
 
    GRANT 
  Follow me! 
 
 They movefor it, butthe rapt
or'shead CRASHES through the  
 ceilin g again,this timeright un derneathLex. 

 
 She SCREAMS and is lifted up, on top of itshead, and pinned to  
 the ceiling above. 
 
 Grant SMASHES hitboot into the si
de of the raptor'shead.  The  
 raptor SLAMS at him, latching on to his bootfor a second before the 
 raptor's ownweight pulls it back down. 

 
 Lex goes down with the raptor, 
spinning into the hole in the  
 ceiling, tumbling down.  Grant grabs her bythe collar at the last  
 second,but Lex dangles 
there, above the raptor. 
 
 The animal flips over onto itsf
eetand crouches to pounce just  
 as Grant summons hisstrength  and 
jerks Lexback intothe ceiling. 
 
 The raptorsprings, but too late.  Grant and Lex scramble over  
 to the air duct and join Ellie and Tim inside it. 

 
 
136 IN THE AIRDUCT, 
 
 Grant, Ellie, and the kids crawl 
through the air duct asfast at  
 theycan, the thin metal BOOMINGand 
creasing around them.  They reach  
 a metal gate that shows daylight be
neath.  Grant reaches out and pulls  
 it up. 
 

 Throughthe gate, they cansee th
e lobby of the visitor'scenter  
 below.  They're directly above the 
skeletons of the dinosaurs, the T- 
 rex andthe sauropod it's attackin
g.  The unfinished skeletons are  
 surrounded by scaffolding. 
 
 
137 INT ROTUNDA DAY 
 
 Grant and the others climb down 
out of the ai r duct and onto a  
 platform ofthe scaffolding that stan
ds alongside the sk
eletons.  They  
 continuedown to the second platfo
rm, then the third.  They suddenly  
 see - - 
  
 A RAPTOR, standing to the side
 bythe secondfloor railing. 
 
 It's much too far to jump to the lobby floor, soGrant climbs  
 gingerly onto thenearest skel
eton, thetowering brachiosaur. 
  

 Theyclimb down as fast asthey can. Grant helps Tim down,Lex  
 andEllie follow. Ellie goes to the tail.  Lex moves to the front.  
 Grant land s onthe main body in th
e middle withTim.  And the raptor  
 watches th em. 
  
 Up in the ceiling, the skeleton's anchor bolts GROAN in the  
 plaster, starting to pull free.  But for now,theyhold. 
 
 The raptorflies out and lands on
 the back of the middle section  
 of the skeleton. SNAP! 
 It CRAC KS apart with the weight, sending the  
 sections spinning in all different directions. 
  
 Grant  and Tim t wirl on t he middle sect ion. Timbegins t o slide  
 down.  Granttries to hold on tohim - - but Tim loses his grip and  
 falls to theground right un derneath
 the swinging, large middle section  
 of the dinosaur skeleton. 

 
 Meanwhile, Lex spins on the frontsection.  She slips - - and  
 tries to keep from falling as she hangs byher legs. 
 
 The anchorbolts in theceiling 
RIP free, ZINGING past them like  
 bullets.  The entire brachiosaur sk
eleton collapses like a house of  
 cards sendingEllie to the ground. 
She covers herself with her arms,  
 trying to protect herhead from the show er offalling bones. 
  
 Lex falls, landing on the ground with bonesfalling on topof  

 he r.  She SCREAMS. 
  
 Grant, alone in the middle sectio
n, looks up and sees the cable  
 aboutto SNAP - -hefalls!  The la
rge section of theskeleton comes  
 careening down, heading straight for Tim, who lays where he fell on the  
 ground.  Itcomes SMASHING down.. . 
with  ju st en ough space forhim to  
 be safe. 
  
 The raptortumbles to the floor
 in a cascade ofsplintering  
 bone. 
 
 It lands on its back afew yards 
away and staggers for amoment,  
 thewind knocked out of it. 
  
 Grant lands in  front ofTim.  He stands, and goes to Tim. Lex  
 sits up andsees the raptor 
regainits feet. She SCREAMS. 
 
 Ellie stands.  She notices the 
shadows of the second raptor,  
 standingbehind the visqueen. She st
opsdead in her tracks. Shebacks  
 up towardsGrant and Tim. 
 
 The raptorcomes outfrom underthe plastic and looks around.   
 Grant getsTim out from under the sk
eleton.Lex joins them.  They back  
 awayfrom the raptor, approachingfr
om the left  side. They back up  
 towardsthe large rock in the middl
e of the room holding the other  
 skeleton. 
 

 The raptorcrouch in their pre-attack stance-- 
  
 The group is caught inthe 
middle of the two approaching 
 raptors. 
  
 Lex looks back and SCREAMS. Grant andthe others continue to  
 backup.  They look up andsee - - 
 
 - -TYRANNOSAURUS REX! It's ma
ssive headdescends downfrom  
 above.  A set of six-foot jawsclam
p down on the raptor.Eighteen-inch  
 teeth sink into its side, andthehelpless animal HOWLS in agony as  
 it's lifted up, up,up offthe floor ofthe lobby. 
 
 Grant and the others look up in 
stunned amazement. They step  
 back behind the rock for safety and look to theright. They see  
 another raptor approaching. 

 
 The other raptor goesup inthe 
air now, twentyf
eet off of the  
 lobby floor, held fast inthe mouthof th e Rex. It stan ds in  the  
 entrancetothe lobby in front ofthe massive hole it ripped through  
 the Visqueenwall.  It shakes its enormous head once, BREAKING theneck  
 of the velociraptor, then drops it
,dead, tothe floor at itsfeet. 
 
 Grant, Ellie, and the kids skir
t the battle royal on the lobby 
 floor and dash of the door
 of the Visitor's Center. 
 

 The secondraptor turns from the 
humans andlunges atthe Rex's  
 side, leaping twelve feet into the 
air and rending the Rex's flesh as  
 it comes down, slashing it 
open with its six-inch claw. 
 
 Th e rex BELLOWS in  pain , an dtu rn
s onthe raptor, eyes raging,  
 and strikes, just once,quickly, asfa
st asthehead of a serpent.  It  
 catches the raptor by thick back en
d, buts oneof its enormous feet  
 down on it,and tears. 
  

 It rips the last velociraptor in half. 
  
 Th e rexwh irls arou n d - as it tu rn s, its h eavy tail  
 counterbalances, SNAPPING the other 
way, sweeping across the lobby and  
 SMASHINGright through the T-rexskeleton. 
  
 The skeleton collapses in an explosion of bones, falling to 
 pieces around the living rex. 
  

 The rexstands majestically in 
themiddle of the lobby, both  
 skeletons swept away,SNAPPING like matchsticks as theysettle around  
 the animal. 
 
 The rexdraws itself upto its full height -- 
 
 - - an dROARS. 
 
 The sound is deafenin
g, and the vibrations 
rattle the entire  
 Visitor's Center. The signwhich 
dangled over the lobby by its one  
 remainingwire finally falls, CLATTERING to the floor at the Rex's  
 feet, face up. 
 
 "WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THEEARTH", itsays.

 other by HAMMOND. 
 
 
INT HELICOPTERDAY 
 
 One by one, they climb aboard
, their faceswhite from their  
 ordeal. 
 

 ELLIE comes onfirst,holding LEX. Then HAMMOND, carrying TIM.  
 And GRANT, helping MALCOLM. 
 
 No one speaks. Hammond takes another lookat his dream, Grant  
 comes over andtakeshim back to thehelicopter. 
 
 Thehelicopter takes offimmediately. Astheyrise into the  
 air, they stare out the 
windows, looking downon 
the park as it spreads  
 out below. 

 
 
140 DOWN IN THE PARK, 
 
 thehelicopter soars over a vast plain.  The Tyrannosaur,which  
 is st ill feeding on the remains of the dinosaurs it  ran down and  
 killed, looks up. 
 
 It throw s  its head back and ROARS, w av ing its little forelimbs  

 at the strange thing in frustration.As the helicopter moves off, the  
 T-rex just stares, silently, with huge, yellowing eyes. It'sa moment  
 of utter bewilderment for the rex,andwe almost feel - - 
 
 - - sad for her. 
 
 

141 BACK IN THE HELICOPTER, 
 
 Hammond looks downat the park, his eyesfull.   He looks over at  
 the kids. 
 
 They're inthe back of
the helicopter, with Grant. Asthey look  
 out thewindow, Grantalmost absent
ly has hisarms around both kids. 
 
 No w Ellie looks at h im.  Both  h e
 and the kids seem so natural,  
 so obviously comfortable and trustingwith each other. She smiles. 

 
 The four ofthem sit that way, in the back of the helicopter,  
 huddled together.  Surviv ors. 
 
 Grant looksout thewindow. 
 
 Thehelicopter sweeps low over ahuge flock of sea birds that's  
 feeding ona school offi
sh. Asthechopper ROARS near, it kicksupthe  
 flock.  Hundreds of birds sail o
ff inall directions, powerfuland  
 graceful. 
 
 Grant looksat the bidsand breaksinto a widegrin. 
 
 The birds reform as flock again and fly straightinto thesun. 
 
 FADE OUT.
